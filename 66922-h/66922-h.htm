<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>This book was published in 1865. It was, as the Preface notes, a
“literal” and “exact” copy of the original book published in 1674,
and so retained the spelling, the punctuation and the copious
italicizing of the original. (The errata in the 1674 book were
applied.)</p>

<p>This etext maintains this careful reproduction of the 1674 text,
with some exceptions that are noted at <a href="#TN">the end of the book</a>.</p>

<p>The page numbers of the 1674 book are embedded in the text and
etext in [ ] brackets; for example [p. 75.]</p>

<p>The 1865 publisher inserted two corrections in [ ] brackets; they
have been retained in this etext without change:<br />
<span class="pad1"><a href="#tn-9">page 9</a>: “the Ships trine [trim?] a foot by the stern”</span><br />
<span class="pad1"><a href="#tn-157">page 157</a>: “20 English miles, [leagues?] or 60 miles”.</span></p>

<p>The dates in the book of course accord with the Julian calendar.
Dual dating was (sometimes) used for events between January 1st
and March 25th (the end of a Julian year), for example on <a href="#tn-204a">page
204</a>: “the 24 of <em>January</em> 1659/60 landed at”.

<p class="drop-cap">The work published by Josselyn in 1672, entitled
“New England’s Rarities discovered,”
which has been reprinted in a similar
form, and as a companion volume to
the present, contains a full and detailed account of the
family of the author, with many curious facts relating to
the personal history of this early explorer of New England;
but it has been thought expedient to prefix to his
narrative a genealogical chart of the family, copied from
a paper among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum,
the substance of which has been printed in the
“New England Historical and Genealogical Register,”
and which is now kindly furnished for publication by
Samuel G. Drake, Esq. The table now published will
be found generally to confirm the information given in
the account of the family already published.</p>

<p>The first of the “Two Voyages” of Josselyn, of which
he gives an account in the present work, was undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
in the year 1638, only eight years after the settlement of
Boston, and when, to use his own words, “it was rather a
village than a town, there being not above twenty or thirty
houses;” while the second visit of the author to New England
took place in 1663, after an absence of twenty-five
years, and when the town had assumed the proportions of a
flourishing seaport. On this occasion he appears to have
remained in New England for eight years, the principal
part of which was spent on the plantation of his brother,
Henry Josselyn, at Black Point.</p>

<p>This work is the latest of the author’s productions,
and was not given to the public until 1674. It was reprinted
by the Massachusetts Historical Society in 1833,
and may be found in the third volume of the third series
of their collections. Josselyn’s observations on the natural
history of the country, his descriptions of the various
plants and notices of their medicinal effects, are more full
and exact in the present work than in the “New England’s
Rarities,” printed two years earlier, and must be
considered as among the most valuable of those given by
the early botanists of New England.</p>

<p>The political and theological opinions of Josselyn were
not in accordance with those generally received in the
Colonies, particularly in the later years of his life. On
this subject, Prof. Tuckerman, in his Introduction to the
work last mentioned, remarks that, “In the account of his
first voyage, there is no appearance of that dislike to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
Massachusetts government and people which is observable
in the narrative of the second; and may there not unfairly
be connected with his brother’s political and religious
differences with Massachusetts.” There is sufficient evidence
in this work to show that the sympathies of the
author were enlisted in the royal cause, and there appears
to be little ground for admitting his supposed complicity
in the fruitless insurrection in the north of England in
1663, or his identity with the “Capt. John Jossline” mentioned
by the late Rev. Joseph Hunter in his account of
the family.</p>

<p>The chronological table appended to his “New-England’s
Rarities” is greatly enlarged in the present work,
and continued to the year 1674.</p>

<p>In reprinting this rare and curious volume, great care
has been taken to make it a <em>literal</em> and <em>exact copy</em> of the
original, the proofs having been carefully collated with a
copy of the work belonging to the Library of Harvard
College.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><em>Anno Dom.</em> 1638. <em>April</em> the 26th being <em>Thursday</em>,
I came to <em>Gravesend</em> and went aboard the
<i>New Supply</i>, <em>alias</em>, the <i>Nicholas of London</i>, a
Ship of good force, of 300 Tuns burden, carrying 20 Sacre
and Minion, man’d with 48 Sailers, the Master <em>Robert
Taylor</em>, the Merchant or undertaker Mr. <em>Edward Tinge</em>,
with 164 Passengers men, women and children.</p>

<p>[p. 2.] At <em>Gravesend</em> I began my Journal, from
whence we departed on the 26. of <em>April</em>, about Six of
the clock at night, and went down into the <em>Hope</em>.</p>

<p>The 27. being <em>Fryday</em>, we set sail out of the <em>Hope</em>, and
about Nine of the clock at night we came to an Anchor
in <em>Margaret</em>-Road in three fathom and a half water: by
the way we past a States man of war, of 500 Tun, cast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
away a month before upon the <em>Goodwin</em>, nothing remaining
visible above water but her main mast top, 16 of
her men were drowned, the rest saved by Fishermen.</p>

<p>The 28. we twined into the Downs, where Captain
<em>Clark</em> one of His Majesties Captains in the Navy, came
aboard of us in the afternoon, and prest two of our
Trumpeters. Here we had good store of Flounders from
the Fishermen, new taken out of the Sea and living,
which being readily gutted, were fry’d while they were
warm; me thoughts I never tasted of a delicater Fish in
all my life before.</p>

<p>The Third of <em>May</em> being <em>Ascension</em> day, in the afternoon
we weighed out of the <em>Downs</em>, the wind at <em>E.</em> and ran
down into <em>Dover</em> Road, and lay by the lee, whilst they
sent the Skiffe ashore for one of the Masters mates: by the
way we past <em>Sandwich</em> in the [p. 3.] <em>Hope</em>, <em>Sandown-Castle</em>,
<em>Deal</em>; So we steered away for <em>Doniesse</em>, from thence we
steered <em>S. W. ½S.</em> for the <em>Beachie</em>, about one of the clock
at night the wind took us a stayes with a gust, rain, thunder
and lightning, and now a Servant of one of the passengers
sickned of the small pox.</p>

<p>The Fifth day in the afternoon we Anchored, the <em>Isle</em> of
<em>Wight</em> <em>W. N. W.</em> 10 leagues off, <em>Beachie</em> <em>E. N. E.</em> 8
leagues off, rode in 32 fathom water at low water, at 8
of the clock at night the land over the Needles bore <em>N.
W.</em> 4 leagues off, we steered <em>W.</em> afore the Start, at noon
the Boult was <em>N. W.</em> by <em>W.</em> about 3½ leagues off, we
were becalmed from 7 of the clock in the morning, till
12 of the clock at noon, where we took good store of
<em>Whitings</em>, and half a score <em>Gurnets</em>, this afternoon an infinite
number of <em>Porpisces</em> shewed themselves above water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
round about the Ship, as far as we could kenn, the night
proved tempestuous with much lightning and thunder.</p>

<p>The Sixth day being <em>Sunday</em>, at five of the clock at
night the <em>Lizard</em> was <em>N. W.</em> by <em>W.</em> 6 leagues off, and the
<em>Blackhead</em> which is to the westward of <em>Falmouth</em> was <em>N.
W.</em> about 5 leagues off.</p>

<p>The Seventh day the uttermost part of <em>Silly</em> was <em>N. E.</em>
12 leagues off, and now we began to sail by the logg.</p>

<p>[p. 4.] The Eighth day, one <em>Boremans</em> man a passenger
was duck’d at the main yards arm (for being drunk
with his Masters strong waters which he stole) thrice, and
fire given to two whole Sacree, at that instant. Two mighty
Whales we now saw, the one spouted water through two
great holes in her head into the Air a great height, and
making a great noise with puffing and blowing, the Seamen
called her a Soufler; the other was further off, about
a league from the Ship, fighting with the Sword-fish, and
the Flail-fish, whose stroakes with a fin that growes upon
her back like a flail, upon the back of the Whale, we
heard with amazement: when presently some more than
half as far again we spied a spout from above, it came
pouring down like a River of water; So that if they
should light in any Ship, she were in danger to presently
sunk down into the Sea, and falleth with such an extream
violence all whole together as one drop, or as water out
of a Vessel, and dured a quarter of an hour, making the
Sea to boyle like a pot, and if any Vessel be near, it sucks
it in. I saw many of these spouts afterwards at nearer
distance. In the afternoon the Mariners struck a Porpisce,
called also a <em>Marsovius</em> or Sea-hogg, with an harping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Iron, and hoisted her aboard, [p. 5.] they cut some
of it into thin pieces, and fryed, it tasts like rusty Bacon,
or hung Beef, if not worse; but the Liver boiled and
soused sometime in Vinegar is more grateful to the pallat.
About 8 of the clock at night, a flame settled upon the
main mast, it was about the bigness of a great Candle,
and is called by our Seamen St. <em>Elmes</em> fire, it comes before
a storm, and is commonly thought to be a Spirit; if
two appear they prognosticate safety: These are known
to the learned by the names of <em>Castor</em> and <em>Pollux</em>, to the
<em>Italians</em> by St. <em>Nicholas</em> and St. <em>Hermes</em>, by the <em>Spaniards</em>
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpos Santos</i>.</p>

<p>The Ninth day, about two of the clock in the afternoon,
we found the head of our main mast close to the cap
twisted and shivered, and we presently after found the
fore-top-mast crackt a little above the cap; So they
wolled them both, and about two of the clock in the
morning 7 new long Boat oars brake away from our Starboard
quarter with a horrid crack.</p>

<p>The Eleventh day, they observed and made the Ship
to be in latitude 48 degrees 46 minuts, having a great
Sea all night; about 6 of the clock in the morning we
spake with Mr. <em>Rupe</em> in a Ship of <em>Dartmouth</em>, which
came from <em>Marcelloes</em>; and now is <em>Silly</em> <em>N. E.</em> by <em>E.</em> 34
leagues off; [p. 6.] about 9 of the clock at night we
sounded, and had 85 fathom water, small brownish pepperie
sand, with a small piece of <em>Hakes</em> Tooth, and now
we are 45 leagues off the <em>Lizard</em>, great Seas all night,
and now we see to the <em>S. W.</em> six tall Ships, the wind being
<em>S. W.</em></p>

<p>The Twelfth day being <em>Whitsunday</em>, at prayer-time we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
<a id="tn-9"></a>found the Ships trine [trim?] a foot by the stern, and
also the partie that was sick of the small pox now dyed,
whom we buried in the Sea, tying a bullet (as the manner
is) to his neck, and another to his leggs, turned him
out at a Port-hole, giving fire to a great Gun. In the
afternoon one <em>Martin Ivy</em> a stripling, servant to Captain
<em>Thomas Cammock</em> was whipt naked at the Cap-stern, with
a Cat with Nine tails, for filching 9 great Lemmons out
of the <em>Chirurgeons</em> Cabbin, which he eat rinds and all in
less than an hours time.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth day we took a Sharke, a great one, and
hoisted him aboard with his two Companions (for there
is never a Sharke, but hath a mate or two) that is the
Pilot-fish or Pilgrim, which lay upon his back close to a
long finn; the other fish (somewhat bigger than the Pilot)
about two foot long, called a <em>Remora</em>, it hath no scales
and sticks close to the Sharkes belly. [p. 7.] So the
Whale hath the Sea-gudgeon, a small fish for his mate,
marching before him, and guiding him; which I have
seen likewise. The Seamen divided the Sharke into quarters,
and made more quarter about it than the Purser,
when he makes five quarters of an Oxe, and after they
had cooked him, he proved very rough Grain’d not worthy
of wholesome preferment; but in the afternoon we
took store of <em>Bonitoes</em>, or Spanish <em>Dolphins</em>, a fish about
the size of a large Mackarel, beautified with admirable
varietie of glittering colours in the water, and was excellent
food.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth day we spake with a <em>Plimouth</em> man
(about dinner time) bound for <em>New-found-land</em>, who having
gone up west-ward sprang a leak, and now bore back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
for <em>Plimouth</em>. Now was <em>Silly</em> 50 leagues off, and now
many of the passengers fall sick of the small Pox and
Calenture.</p>

<p>The Sixteenth Mr. <em>Clarke</em>, who came out of the <em>Downs</em>
with us, and was bound for the Isle of <em>Providence</em>, one
of the summer Islands; the <em>Spaniards</em> having taken it
a little before, though unknown to <em>Clarke</em>, and to Captain
<em>Nathaniel Butler</em> going Governour, they departed from
us the Wind <em>N. W.</em> great Seas and stormie winds all
night.</p>

<p>[p. 8.] The Seventeenth day, the wind at <em>N. W.</em> about
8 of the clock we saw 5 great Ships bound for the <em>Channel</em>,
which was to the Westward of us, about two leagues
off, we thought them to be <em>Flemmings</em>; here we expected
to have met with Pirates, but were happily deceived.</p>

<p>The One and twentieth day, the wind <em>S.</em> by <em>W.</em> great
Seas and Wind, in’d our courses, and tryed from 5 of
the clock afternoon, till 4 in the morning, the night being
very stormie and dark; we lost Mr. <em>Goodlad</em> and his Ship,
who came out with us, and bound for <em>Boston</em> in <em>New-England</em>.</p>

<p>The Eight and twentieth day, all this while a very great
grown Sea and mighty winds.</p>

<p><em>June</em> the first day in the afternoon, very thick foggie
weather, we sailed by an inchanted Island, saw a great
deal of filth and rubbish floating by the Ship, heard
<em>Cawdimawdies</em>, <em>Sea-gulls</em> and <em>Crowes</em>, (Birds that always
frequent the shoar) but could see nothing by reason of the
mist: towards Sunset, when we were past the Island, it
cleared up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>The Fourteenth day of <em>June</em>, very foggie weather, we
sailed by an Island of Ice (which lay on the Star-board
side) three leagues in length mountain high, in form of
[p. 9.] land, with Bayes and Capes like high clift land,
and a River pouring off it into the Sea. We saw likewise
two or three Foxes, or Devils skipping upon it.
These Islands of Ice are congealed in the North, and
brought down in the spring-time with the Current to the
banks on this side <em>New-found-land</em>, and there stopt, where
they dissolve at last to water; by that time we had sailed
half way by it, we met with a <em>French</em> Pickeroon. Here
it was as cold as in the middle of <em>January</em> in <em>England</em>,
and so continued till we were some leagues beyond it.</p>

<p>The Sixteenth day we sounded, and found 35 fathom
water, upon the bank of <em>New-found-land</em>, we cast out our
hooks for Cod-fish, thick foggie weather, the Codd being
taken on a Sunday morning, the Sectaries aboard threw
those their servants took into the Sea again, although
they wanted fresh victuals, but the Sailers were not so
nice, amongst many that were taken, we had some that
were wasted Fish, &amp; it is observable and very strange, that
fishes bodies do grow slender with age, their Tails and
Heads retaining their former bigness; Fish of all Creatures
have generally the biggest heads, and the first part
that begins to taint in a fish is the head.</p>

<p>The Nineteenth day, Captain <em>Thomas Cammock</em> [p. 10.]
(a near kinsman of the Earl of <em>Warwicks</em>) now had another
lad <em>Thomas Jones</em>, that dyed of the small pox at
eight of the clock at night.</p>

<p>The Twentieth day, we saw a great number of Sea-bats,
or Owles, called also flying fish, they are about the bigness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
of a Whiting, with four tinsel wings, with which they fly
as long as they are wet, when pursued by other fishes.
Here likewise we saw many Grandpisces or Herring-hogs,
hunting the scholes of Herrings, in the afternoon we saw
a great fish called the <em>vehuella</em> or Sword fish, having a
long, strong and sharp finn like a Sword-blade on the top
of his head, with which he pierced our Ship, and broke
it off with striving to get loose, one of our Sailers dived
and brought it aboard.</p>

<p>The One and twentieth day, we met with two <em>Bristow</em>
men bound for <em>New-England</em>, and now we are 100 and
75 leagues off <em>Cape-Sable</em>, the sandy <em>Cape</em>, for so <em>Sable</em> in
French signifieth, off of which lyeth the Isle of <em>Sable</em>,
which is beyond <em>New-found-land</em>, where they take the
<em>Amphibious</em> Creature, the <em>Walrus</em>, <em>Mors</em>, or <em>Sea-Horse</em>.</p>

<p>The Two and twentieth, another passenger dyed of a
Consumption. Now we passed by the Southern part of
<em>New-found-land</em>, [p. 11.] within sight of it; the Southern
part of <em>New-found-land</em> is said to be not above 600
leagues from <em>England</em>.</p>

<p>The Six and twentieth day, Capt. <em>Thomas Cammock</em>
went aboard of a Barke of 300 Tuns, laden with Island
Wine, and but 7 men in her, and never a Gun, bound
for <em>Richmonds</em> Island, set out by Mr. <em>Trelaney</em>, of <em>Plimouth</em>,
exceeding hot weather now.</p>

<p>The Eight and twentieth, one of Mr. <em>Edward Ting’s</em>
the undertakers men now dyed of the Phthisick.</p>

<p>The Nine and twentieth day, sounded at night, and
found 120 fathome water, the head of the Ship struck
against a rock; At 4 of the clock we descryed two sail
bound for <em>New-found-land</em>, and so for the <em>Streights</em>, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
told us of a general Earth-quake in <em>New-England</em>, of the
Birth of a Monster at <em>Boston</em>, in the <em>Massachusets-Bay</em> a
mortality, and now we are two leagues off <em>Cape Ann</em>.</p>

<p>The Thirtieth day proved stormie, and having lost the
sight of the Land, we saw none untill the morning;
doubtfully discovering the Coast, fearing the Lee-shore
all night we bore out to Sea.</p>

<p><em>July</em> the first day, we sounded at 8 of the clock at
night, and found 93 fathome water, descried land.</p>

<p>The Third day, we Anchored in the <em>Bay</em> of [p. 12.]
<em>Massachusets</em> before <em>Boston</em>. Mr. <em>Tinges</em> other man now
dyed of the small pox.</p>

<p>The Tenth day, I went a shore upon <em>Noddles Island</em> to
Mr. <em>Samuel Maverick</em> (for my passage) the only hospitable
man in all the Countrey, giving entertainment to all
Comers <em>gratis</em>.</p>

<p>Now before I proceed any further, it will not be Impertinent
to give the intending planter some Instructions
for the furnishing of himself with things necessary, and
for undertaking the Transport of his Family, or any
others.</p>

<p>To which end observe, that a Ship of 150 Tuns, with
2 Decks and a half, and 26 men, with 12 pieces of
Ordnance, the charge will amount <em>per</em> moneth, with the
Mariners, to 120 pound <em>per</em> moneth. It is better to let
the Owners undertake for the Victualling of the Mariners,
and their pay for Wages, and the Transporter only
to take care of the passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>


<p class="p1 center"><em>The common proportion of Victuals for the Sea to a Mess,
being 4 men, is as followeth</em>;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Two pieces of Beef, of 3 pound and ¼ <em>per</em> piece.</p>

<p>Four pound of <em>Bread</em>.</p>

<p>One pint ½ of <em>Pease</em>.</p>

<p>[p. 13.] Four Gallons of <em>Bear</em>, with <em>Mustard</em> and <em>Vinegar</em>
for three flesh dayes in the week.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">For four fish dayes, to each mess <em>per</em> day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Two pieces of <em>Codd</em> or <em>Habberdine</em>, making three pieces
of a fish.</p>

<p>One quarter of a pound of <em>Butter</em>.</p>

<p>Four pound of <em>Bread</em>.</p>

<p>Three quarters of a pound of <em>Cheese</em>.</p>
</div>

<p class="center"><em>Bear</em> as before.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><em>Oatmeal per</em> day, for 50 men, Gallon 1. and so proportionable
for more or fewer.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus you see the Ships provision, is <em>Beef</em> or <em>Porke</em>,
<em>Fish</em>, <em>Butter</em>, <em>Cheese</em>, <em>Pease</em>, <em>Pottage</em>, <em>Water-gruel</em>, <em>Bisket</em>,
and six shilling <em>Bear</em>.</p>

<p>For private fresh provision, you may carry with you
(in case you, or any of yours should be sick at Sea) Conserves
of <em>Roses</em>, <em>Clove-Gilliflowers</em>, <em>Wormwood</em>, <em>Green-Ginger</em>,
<em>Burnt-Wine</em>, English <em>Spirits</em>, <em>Prunes</em> to stew, <em>Raisons</em>
of the <em>Sun</em>, <em>Currence</em>, <em>Sugar</em>, <em>Nutmeg</em>, <em>Mace</em>, <em>Cinnamon</em>,
<em>Pepper</em> and <em>Ginger</em>, White <em>Bisket</em>, or <em>Spanish rusk</em>, <em>Eggs</em>,
<em>Rice</em>, <em>juice of Lemmons</em> well put up to cure, or prevent the
Scurvy. Small <em>Skillets</em>, <em>Pipkins</em>, <em>Porrengers</em>, and small
<em>Frying pans</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>To prevent or take away Sea sickness, Conserve of
<em>Wormwood</em> is very proper, but these following Troches I
prefer before it.</p>

<p>First make paste of <em>Sugar</em> and <em>Gum-Dragagant</em> mixed
together, then mix therewith [p. 14.] a reasonable quantitie
of the powder of <em>Cinnamon</em> and <em>Ginger</em>, and if you
please a little <em>Musk</em> also, and make it up into Roules of
several fashions, which you may gild, of this when you are
troubled in your Stomach, take and eat a quantity according
to discretion.</p>

<p class="p1">Having refreshed my self for a day or two upon <em>Noddles-Island</em>,
I crossed the Bay in a small Boat to <em>Boston</em>,
which then was rather a Village, than a Town, there being
not [p. 20.] above Twenty or thirty houses; and presenting
my respects to Mr. <em>Winthorpe</em> the Governour, and
to Mr. <em>Cotton</em> the Teacher of <em>Boston</em> Church, to whom I
delivered from Mr. <em>Francis Quarles</em> the poet, the Translation
of the 16, 25, 51, 88, 113, and 137. Psalms into
<em>English</em> Meeter, for his approbation, being civilly treated
by all I had occasion to converse with, I returned in the
Evening to my lodging.</p>

<p>The Twelfth day of <em>July</em>, after I had taken my leave
of Mr. <em>Maverick</em>, and some other Gentlemen, I took Boat
for the Eastern parts of the Countrie, and arrived at
<em>Black point</em> in the Province of <em>Main</em>, which is 150 miles
from <em>Boston</em>, the Fourteenth day, which makes my voyage
11 weeks and odd dayes.</p>

<p>The Countrey all along as I sailed, being no other than
a meer Wilderness, here and there by the Sea-side a few
scattered plantations, with as few houses.</p>

<p>About the Tenth of <em>August</em>, I hapned to walk into the
Woods, not far from the Sea-side, and falling upon a piece
of ground over-grown with bushes, called there black
Currence, but differing from our Garden Currence, they
being ripe and hanging in lovely bunches; I set up my
piece against a stately Oake, with a resolution to fill my
[p. 21.] belly, being near half a mile from the house; of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
a sudden I heard a hollow thumping noise upon the
Rocks approaching towards me, which made me presently
to recover my piece, which I had no sooner cock’d,
than a great and grim over-grown she-Wolf appears, at
whom I shot, and finding her Gor-belly stuft with flesh
newly taken in, I began presently to suspect that she had
fallen foul upon our Goats, which were then valued (our
she Goats) at Five pound a Goat; Therefore to make further
discovery, I descended (it being low water) upon the
Sea sands, with an intent to walk round about a neck of
land where the Goats usually kept. I had not gone far
before I found the footing of two Wolves, and one Goat
betwixt them, whom they had driven into a hollow, betwixt
two Rocks, hither I followed their footing, and perceiving
by the Crowes, that there was the place of slaughter,
I hung my piece upon my back, and upon all four
clambered up to the top of the Rock, where I made
ready my piece and shot at the dog Wolf, who was feeding
upon the remainder of the Goat, which was only the
fore shoulders, head and horns, the rest being devoured
by the she-Wolf, even to the very hair of the Goat: and
it is very observable, that when [p. 22.] the Wolves have
kill’d a Beast, or a Hog, not a Dog-Wolf amongst them
offers to eat any of it, till the she-Wolves have filled their
paunches.</p>

<p>The Twenty fourth of <em>September</em>, being Munday about
4 of the clock in the afternoon, a fearful storm of wind
began to rage, called a <em>Hurricane</em>. <em>It is an impetuous
wind that goes commonly about the Compass in the space of</em>
24 <em>hours, it began from the</em> W. N. W. and continued till
next morning, the greatest mischief it did us, was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
wracking of our Shallop, and the blowing down of many
tall Trees, in some places a mile together.</p>

<p><em>December</em> the Tenth, happened an Eclipse of the Moon
at 8 of the clock at night, it continued till after 11, as
near as we could guess; in old <em>England</em> it began after
midnight, and continued till 4 of <em>the clock in the morning;
if Seamen would make observation of the time, either of
the beginning or ending of the Eclipse, or total darkness of
Sun and Moon in all places where they shall happen to
be, and confer their observations to some Artist, hereby the
longitude of all places might be certainly known, which are
now very uncertainly reported to us</em>.</p>

<p>1639. <em>May</em>, which fell out to be extream hot and foggie,
about the middle of <em>May</em>, I [p. 23.] kill’d within a
stones throw of our house, above four score Snakes, some
of them as big as the small of my leg, black of colour,
and three yards long, with a sharp horn on the tip of
their tail two inches in length.</p>

<p><em>June</em> the Six and twentieth day, very stormie, Lightning
and Thunder. I heard now two of the greatest and
fearfullest thunder-claps that ever were heard, I am confident.
At this time we had some neighbouring Gentlemen
in our house, who came to welcome me into the
Countrey; where amongst variety of discourse they told
me of a young Lyon (not long before) kill’d at <em>Piscataway</em>
by an <em>Indian</em>; of a Sea-<em>Serpent</em> or <em>Snake</em>, that lay
quoiled up like a Cable upon a Rock at <em>Cape-Ann</em>: a
Boat passing by with <em>English</em> aboard, and two <em>Indians</em>,
they would have shot the <em>Serpent</em> but the <em>Indians</em> disswaded
them, saying, that if he were not kill’d out-right,
they would be all in danger of their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>One Mr. <em>Mittin</em> related of a <em>Triton</em> or <em>Mereman</em> which
he saw in <em>Cascobay</em>, the Gentleman was a great Fouler,
and used to goe out with a small Boat or Canow, and
fetching a compass about a small Island, (there being
many small Islands in the Bay) for the advantage of a
shot, was encountred [p. 24.] with a <em>Triton</em>, who laying
his hands upon the side of the Canow, had one of them
chopt off with a Hatchet by Mr. <em>Mittin</em>, which was in all
respects like the hand of a man, the <em>Triton</em> presently sunk,
dying the water with his purple blood, and was no more
seen. The next story was told by Mr. <em>Foxwell</em>, now living
in the province of <em>Main</em>, who having been to the
Eastward in a Shallop, as far as <em>Cape-Ann</em> a Waggon in
his return was overtaken by the night, and fearing to land
upon the barbarous shore, he put off a little further to
Sea; about midnight they were wakened with a loud
voice from the shore, calling upon <em>Foxwell</em>, <em>Foxwell</em> come
a shore, two or three times: upon the Sands they saw a
great fire, and Men and Women hand in hand dancing
round about it in a ring, after an hour or two they vanished,
and as soon as the day appeared, <em>Foxwell</em> puts into a small
<em>Cove</em>, it being about three quarters floud, and traces along
the shore, where he found the footing of Men, Women
and Children shod with shoes; and an infinite number of
brands-ends thrown up by the water, but neither <em>Indian</em>
nor <em>English</em> could he meet with on the shore, nor in the
woods; these with many other stories they told me, the
credit whereof I will neither impeach nor inforce, but
shall [p. 25.] satisfie my self, and I hope the Reader
hereof, with the saying of a wise, learned and honourable
Knight, <em>that there are many Stranger things in the world,
than are to be seen between</em> London <em>and</em> Stanes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p><em>September</em> the Sixth day, one Mr. <em>John Hickford</em> the
Son of Mr. <em>Hickford</em> a Linnen-Draper in <em>Cheapside</em>, having
been some time in the province of <em>Main</em>, and now
determined to return for <em>England</em>, sold and kill’d his stock
of Cattle and Hoggs, one great Sow he had which he
made great account of, but being very fat, and not suspecting
that she was with pig, he caused her to be kill’d, and
they found 25 pigs within her belly; verifying the old
proverb, As fruitful as a white sow. And now we were
told of a sow in <em>Virginia</em> that brought forth six pigs;
their fore-parts Lyons, their hinder-parts hogs. <em>I have
read that at</em> Bruxels, Anno 1564. <em>a sow brought forth six
pigs, the first whereof (for the last in generating is always
in bruit beasts the first brought forth) had the head, face,
arms and legs of a man, but the whole trunck of the body
from the neck, was of a swine, a sodomitical monster is
more like the mother than the father in the organs of the
vegetative soul.</em></p>

<p>The Three and twentieth, I left <em>Black-point</em>, and came
to <em>Richmonds</em> Island about [p. 26.] three leagues to the
Eastward, where Mr. <em>Tralanie</em> kept a fishing, Mr. <em>John
Winter</em> a grave and discreet man was his Agent, and imployer
of 60 men upon that design.</p>

<p>The Four and twentieth day being <em>Munday</em>, I went
aboard the <em>Fellowship</em> of 100 and 70 Tuns a Flemish bottom,
the Master <em>George Luxon</em> of <em>Bittiford</em> in <em>Devonshire</em>,
several of my friends came to bid me farewell, among the
rest Captain <em>Thomas Wannerton</em> who drank to me a pint
of kill-devil <em>alias</em> Rhum at a draught, at 6 of the clock in
the morning we weighed Anchor, and set sail for the <em>Massachusets-bay</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>The Seven and twentieth day being <em>Fryday</em>, we Anchored
in the afternoon in the <em>Massachusets-bay</em> before
<em>Boston</em>. Next day I went aboard of <em>Mr. Hinderson</em>, Master
of a ship of 500 Tuns, and Captain <em>Jackson</em> in the
Queen of <em>Bohemia</em> a privateer, and from thence I went
ashore to <em>Boston</em>, where I refreshed my self at an Ordinary.
Next morning I was invited to a fisherman’s house somewhat
lower within the <em>Bay</em>, and was there by his Wife
presented with a handful of small Pearl, but none of them
bored nor orient. From thence I crost the Bay to
<em>Charles-town</em>, where at one <em>Longs</em> Ordinary I met with
Captain <em>Jackson</em> and others, walking on the back side we
spied a rattle [p. 27.] Snake a yard and half long, and
as thick in the middle as the small of a mans leg, on the
belly yellow, her back spotted with black, russet, yellow
and green, placed like scales, at her tail she had a rattle
which is nothing but a hollow shelly buffiness joynted,
look how many years old she is, so many rattles she hath
in her tail, her neck seemed to be no bigger than ones
Thumb; yet she swallowed a live Chicken, as big as one
they give 4 pence for in <em>England</em>, presently as we were
looking on. In the afternoon I returned to our Ship,
being no sooner aboard but we had the sight of an <em>Indian</em>-Pinnace
sailing by us made of <em>Birch-bark</em>, sewed together
with the roots of spruse and white <em>Cedar</em> (drawn
out into threads) with a deck, and trimmed with sails top
and top gallant very sumptuously.</p>

<p>The Thirtieth day of <em>September</em>, I went ashore upon
<em>Noddles</em>-Island, where when I was come to Mr. <em>Mavericks</em>
he would not let me go aboard no more, until the
Ship was ready to set sail; the next day a grave and sober<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
person described the Monster to me, that was born at <em>Boston</em>
of one Mrs. <em>Dyer</em> a great Sectarie, <em>the Nine and twentieth
of</em> June, <em>it was (it should seem) without a head, but
having horns like a Beast, and ears, scales on a rough skin
like a fish</em> [p. 28.] <em>called a</em> Thornback, <em>legs and claws like
a</em> Hawke, <em>and in other respects as a Woman-child</em>.</p>

<p>The Second of <em>October</em>, about 9 of the clock in the
morning, Mr. <em>Mavericks</em> Negro woman came to my chamber
window, and in her own Countrey language and tune
sang very loud and shril, going out to her, she used a
great deal of respect towards me, and willingly would
have expressed her grief in <em>English</em>; but I apprehended
it by her countenance and deportment, whereupon I repaired
to my host, to learn of him the cause, and resolved
to intreat him in her behalf, for that I understood before,
that she had been a Queen in her own Countrey, and
observed a very humble and dutiful garb used towards
her by another Negro who was her maid. Mr. <em>Maverick</em>
was desirous to have a breed of Negroes, and therefore
seeing she would not yield by perswasions to company
with a Negro young man he had in his house; he commanded
him will’d she nill’d she to go to bed to her,
which was no sooner done but she kickt him out again,
this she took in high disdain beyond her slavery, and this
was the cause of her grief. In the afternoon I walked
into the Woods on the back side of the house, and happening
into a [p. 29.] fine broad walk (which was a sledgway)
I wandered till I chanc’t to spye a fruit as I thought
like a pine Apple plated with scales, it was as big as the
crown of a Womans hat; I made bold to step unto it,
with an intent to have gathered it, no sooner had I toucht<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
it, but hundreds of Wasps were about me; at last I
cleared my self from them, being stung only by one upon
the upper lip, glad I was that I scaped so well; But by
that time I was come into the house my lip was swell’d so
extreamly, that they hardly knew me but by my Garments.</p>

<p>The Tenth of <em>October</em>, I went aboard and we fell down
to <em>Nantascot</em>, here Mr. <em>Davies</em> (Mr. <em>Hicks</em> the Apothecarie
in <em>Fleet-streets</em> Son-in-law) dyed of the Phthisick
aboard on a Sunday in the afternoon. The next day Mr.
<em>Luxon</em> our Master having been ashore upon the Governours
Island gave me half a score very fair Pippins which
he brought from thence, there being not one Apple-tree,
nor Pear planted yet in no part of the Countrey, but upon
that Island.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth day, we set sail from <em>Nantascot</em>.</p>

<p>The Sixteenth day Mr. <em>Robert Foster</em>, one of our passengers
Preached aboard upon [p. 30.] the 113 Psalm;
<em>The Lord shall preserve thy going out, &amp; thy coming in</em>;
The Sectaries began to quarrel with him, especially Mr.
<em>Vincent Potter</em>, he who was afterwards questioned for a
Regicide.</p>

<p>The Seventeenth day, towards Sun-set a Lanner settled
upon our main Mast-top, when it was dark I hired one
of the Sailers to fetch her down, and I brought her into
<em>England</em> with much ado, being fain to feed her with hard
Eggs. After this day, we had very cold weather at Sea,
our deck in a morning ore-spread with hoarie frost, and
dangling Isickles hung upon the Ropes. <em>Some say the
Sea is hotter in winter, than in summer; but I did not find
it so.</em></p>

<p><em>November</em> the Fifth day, about three of the clock in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
afternoon, the Mariners observed the rising of a little
black cloud in the <em>N. W.</em> which increasing apace, made
them prepare against a coming storm, the wind in short
time grew to boisterous, bringing after us a huge grown
Sea, at 5 of the clock it was pitchie dark.</p>

<p>The storm augmenting still, the next day about 4 of the

breaches; it continued calm till the 13 day, and all the

by us.</p>

<p>The Four and twentieth, we arrived before <em>Bittiford</em>,

<p class="drop-capy">I have heard of a certain Merchant in the west of <em>England</em>,
who after many great losses, walking upon the
Sea-bank in a calm Sun-shining day; observing the
smoothness of the Sea, coming in with a chequered or
dimpled wave: Ah (quoth he) thou flattering Element,
many a time hast thou inticed me to throw my self and
my fortunes into thy Arms; but thou hast hitherto proved
treacherous; thinking to find thee a Mother of encrease,
I have found thee to be the Mother of mischief and wickedness;
yea the Father of prodigies; therefore, being
now secure, I will trust thee no more: But mark this
mans resolution a while after, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">periculum maris spes lucri
superat</i>. So fared it with me, that having escaped the
dangers of one Voyage, must needs put on a resolution for
a second, wherein I plowed many a churlish billow [p. 34.]
with little or no advantage, but rather to my loss and detriment.
In the setting down, whereof I purpose not to
insist in a methodical way, but according to my quality,
in a plain and brief relation as I have done already; for
I perceive, if I used all the Art that possibly I could, it
would be difficult to please all, for all mens eyes, ears,
faith, judgement, are not of a size. There be a sort of
stagnant stinking spirits, who, like flyes, lye sucking at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
botches of carnal pleasures, and never travelled so much
Sea, as is between <em>Heth-ferry</em>, and <em>Lyon-Key</em>; yet notwithstanding,
(sitting in the Chair of the scornful over
their whists and draughts of intoxication) will desperately
censure the relations of the greatest Travellers. It was a
good <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proviso</i> of a learned man, never to report wonders,
for in so doing, of the greatest he will be sure not to be
believed, but laughed at, which certainly bewraies their
ignorance and want of discretion. Of Fools and Madmen
then I shall take no care, I will not invite these in
the least to honour me with a glance from their supercilious
eyes; but rather advise them to keep their inspection
for their fine-tongu’d Romances, and playes. This homely
piece, I protest ingenuously, is prepared for such only who
well know how to make use of their [p. 35.] charitable
constructions towards works of this nature, to whom I
submit my self in all my faculties, and proceed in my second
voyage.</p>

<p><em>Anno 1663.</em> <em>May</em> the Three and twentieth, I went down
to <em>Gravesend</em>, it being <em>Saturday</em> I lay ashore till <em>Monday</em>
the fifth, about 11 a clock at night, I went aboard the <em>Society</em>
belonging to <em>Boston</em> in the <em>Massachusets</em> a Colony of
<em>English</em> in <em>New-England</em>, of 200 and 20 Tun, carrying
16 Iron Guns most unserviceable, man’d with 33 sailers,
and 77 passengers, men, women and children.</p>

<p>The Six and twentieth day, about 6 of the clock in the
morning we weighed Anchor, and fell down with the tide
three or four miles below <em>Gravesend</em>.</p>

<p>The Seven and twentieth in the afternoon, we weighed
Anchor and came into the <em>Hope</em> before <em>Deal-Castle</em>, here
<a id="tn-31"></a>we were wind bound till</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>The 30 day, we set sail out of the <em>Downs</em>, being <em>Saturday</em>
about 9 of the clock in the morning, about 4 of the
clock in the afternoon we came up with <em>Beachy</em> by <em>W.</em> at
<em>Nore</em>.</p>

<p>The One and thirtieth at 4 of the clock in the morning
we came up with the Isle of <em>Wight</em>, at 4 of the clock in
the afternoon [p. 36.] we had <em>Portland</em> N. N. W. of us, 6
leagues off, the wind being then at <em>N. W. by N.</em> at 5 of
the clock we came to <em>Dartmouth</em>, the wind <em>W. S. W.</em></p>

<p><em>June</em> the first day, being <em>Monday</em> about 4 of the clock
<em>Plimouth</em> was about 9 leagues off, our course <em>W. S. W.</em>
the Start bore North distant about 6 leagues from whence
our reckonings began; the wind now <em>E. N. E.</em> a fair gale.</p>

<p>The second day the <em>Lizard</em> bore <em>N. N. W.</em> in the latitude
51. 300 leagues from <em>Cape-Cod</em> in <em>New England</em>, our
course <em>W.</em> and by <em>S.</em> One of our passengers now dyed of
a Consumption.</p>

<p>The Fifth day we steered <em>S. W.</em> observed and found the
ship in latitude 47 degrees, and 44 minutes.</p>

<p>The Tenth day observed and found the ship in latitude
49 degrees, and 24 minutes.</p>

<p>The Five and twentieth day, about 3 of the clock in
the morning we discovered land, about 6 of the clock
<em>Flowers</em>, so called from abundance of flowers, and <em>Corvo</em>
from a multitude of <em>Crowes</em>; two of the <em>Azores</em> or western
Islands, in the <em>Atlantique Ocean</em> not above 250 leagues
from <em>Lisbon</em> bore <em>N. W.</em> of us some 3 leagues off, we
steered away <em>W.</em> by <em>W.</em> observed and found <em>Flowers</em> to be
in the Southern part in latitude 39 [p. 37.] degrees 13
minuts, we descryed a Village and a small Church or
Chappel seated in a pleasant valley to the Easter-side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
the Island, the whole Island is rockie and mountanious
about 8 miles in compass, stored with Corn, Wine and
Goats, and inhabited by outlaw’d <em>Portingals</em>, the Town
they call <em>Santa Cruz</em>. <em>Corvo</em> is not far from this, I supposed
two or three leagues, a meer mountain, and very
high and steep on all sides, cloathed with tall wood on the
very top, uninhabited, but the <em>Flowreans</em> here keep some
number of Goats.</p>

<p>The Seven and twentieth day, 30 leagues to the westward
of these Islands we met with a small Vessel stoln
from <em>Jamaico</em>, but 10 men in her, and those of several
nations, <em>English</em>, <em>French</em>, <em>Scotch</em>, <em>Dutch</em> almost famish’d,
having been out as they told us, by reason of calms, three
moneths, bound for <em>Holland</em>.</p>

<p><em>July</em> the sixth, calm now for two or three dayes, our
men went out to swim, some hoisted the <em>Shallop</em> out and
took divers Turtles, there being an infinite number of
them all over the Sea as far as we could ken, and a man
may ken at Sea in a clear Air 20 miles, they floated upon
the top of the water being a sleep, and driving gently
upon them with the <em>Shallop</em>, of a sudden [p. 38.] they
took hold of their hinder legs and lifted them into the
boat, if they be not very nimble they awake and presently
dive under water; when they were brought aboard they
sob’d and wept exceedingly, continuing to do so till the
next day that we killed them, by chopping off their heads,
and having taken off their shells (that on their back being
fairest, is called a Gally patch) we opened the body and
took out three hearts in one case, and (which was more
strange) we perceived motion in the hearts ten hours after
they were taken out. I have observed in <em>England</em> in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
youthful dayes the like in the heart of a <em>Pike</em>, and the heart
of a <em>Frog</em>, which will leap and skip as nimbly as the <em>Frog</em>
used to do when it was alive from whom it was taken.
Likewise the heart of a <em>Pig</em> will stir after it is exenterated.
Being at a friends house in <em>Cambridg-shire</em>, the Cook-maid
making ready to slaughter a <em>Pig</em>, she put the hinder parts
between her legs as the usual manner is, and taking the
snout in her left hand with a long knife she stuck the <em>Pig</em>
and cut the small end of the heart almost in two, letting it
bleed as long as any bloud came forth, then throwing of it
into a Kettle of boyling water, the <em>Pig</em> swom twice round
about the kettle, when taking of it out to [p. 39.] the
dresser she rub’d it with powdered <em>Rozen</em> and stript off the
hair, and as she was cutting off the hinder pettito, the <em>Pig</em>
lifts up his head with open mouth, as if it would have bitten:
well, the belly was cut up, and the entrails drawn
out, and the heart laid upon the board, which notwithstanding
the wound it received had motion in it, above
four hours after; there were several of the Family by,
with my self, and we could not otherwayes conclude but
that the <em>Pig</em> was bewitched; but this by the way. Of
the Sea Turtles there be five sorts, first the Trunck-turtle
which is biggest, Secondly, the Loggerhead-turtle.
Thirdly, the Hawkbill-turtle, which with its bill will bite
horribly. Fourthly, the Green-turtle which is best for food,
it is affirmed that the feeding upon this Turtle for a twelve
moneth, forbearing all other kind of food will cure absolutely
Consumptions, and the great pox; They are a very
delicate food, and their Eggs are very wholesome and restorative,
it is an <em>Amphibious</em> Creature going ashore, the
male throws the female on her back when he couples with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
her, which is termed cooting, their Eggs grown to perfection
the female goes ashore again and making a hole in
the Sand, there layes her Eggs which are numerous, I
have seen a peck [p. 40.] of Eggs taken out of one Turtle;
when they have laid they cover the hole again with
sand, and return to the Sea never looking after her Eggs,
which hatching in the sand and coming to some strength
break out and repair to the Sea. Having fill’d our bellies
with Turtles and Bonito’s, called <em>Spanish</em> Dolphins excellently
well cooked both of them, the wind blowing fair,</p>

<p>The Eighth day we spread our sails and went on our
voyage, after a while we met with abundance of Sea-weeds
called Gulf-weed coming out of the Bay of <em>Mexico</em>, and
firr-trees floating on the Sea, observed and found the Ship
to be in 39 degrees and 49 minuts.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth day we took a young Sharke about three
foot long, which being drest and dished by a young Merchant
a passenger happened to be very good fish, having
very white flesh in flakes like Codd but delicately curl’d,
the back-bone which is perfectly round, joynted with short
joynts, the space between not above a quarter of an inch
thick, separated they make fine Table-men, being wrought
on both sides with curious works.</p>

<p>The One and twentieth thick hasie weather.</p>

<p>The Five and twentieth we met with a [p. 41.] <em>Plimouth</em>
man come from St. <em>Malloes</em> in <em>France</em>, 10 weeks out,
laden with cloath, fruit, and honey, bound for <em>Boston</em> in
<em>New-England</em>.</p>

<p>The Six and twentieth we had sight of land.</p>

<p>The Seven and twentieth we Anchored at <em>Nantascot</em>,
in the afternoon I went aboard of a <em>Ketch</em>, with some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
other of our passengers, in hope to get to <em>Boston</em> that
night; but the Master of the <em>Ketch</em> would not consent.</p>

<p>The Eight and twentieth being <em>Tuesday</em>, in the morning
about 5 of the clock he lent us his <em>Shallop</em> and three
of his men, who brought us to the western end of the
town where we landed, and having gratified the men, we
repaired to an Ordinary (for so they call their Taverns
there) where we were provided with a liberal cup of burnt
Madera-wine, and store of plum-cake, about ten of the
clock I went about my Affairs.</p>

<p>Before I pursue my Voyage to an end, I shall give you
to understand what Countrie <em>New-England</em> is. <em>New-England</em>
is that part of <em>America</em>, which together with <em>Virginia</em>,
<em>Mary land</em>, and <em>Nova-scotia</em> were by the <em>Indians</em>
called (by one name) <em>Wingadacoa</em>, after the discovery by
Sir <em>Walter</em> [p. 42.] <em>Rawleigh</em> they were named <em>Virginia</em>,
and so remained untill King <em>James</em> divided the Countrey
into Provinces. <em>New-England</em> then is all that tract of
land that lyes between the Northerly latitudes of 40 and
46, that is from <em>De-la-ware-Bay</em> to <em>New-found-land</em>, some
will have it to be in latitude from 41 to 45. in King <em>Jame’s</em>
Letters Patents to the Council of <em>Plimouth</em> in <em>Devonshire</em>
from 40 to 48 of the same latitude, it is judged to be an
Island, surrounded on the North with the spacious River
of <em>Canada</em>, on the South with <em>Mahegan</em> or <em>Hudsons</em>
River, having their rise, as it is thought, from two great
lakes not far off one another, the Sea lyes East and
South from the land, and is very deep, some say that the
depth of the Sea being measured with line and plummet,
seldom exceeds two or three miles, except in some places
near the <em>Swevian</em>-shores, and about <em>Pontus</em>, observed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
<em>Pliny</em>. Sir <em>Francis Drake</em> threw out 7 Hogsheads of line
near <em>Porto-bello</em> and found no bottom, but whether this be
true or no, or that they were deceived by the Currants
carrying away their lead and line, this is certainly true,
that there is more Sea in the Western than the Eastern
<em>Hemisphere</em>, on the shore in more places than one at
spring-tides, that is at the full or new of the moon, [p. 43.]
the Sea riseth 18 foot perpendicular, the reason of this
great flow of waters I refer to the learned, onely by the
way I shall acquaint you with two reasons for the ebbing
and flowing of the Sea; the one delivered in Common
conference, the other in a Sermon at <em>Boston</em> in the <em>Massachusets-Bay</em>
by an eminent man; The first was, <em>that God
and his spirit moving upon the waters caused the motion</em>;
the other, <em>that the spirit of the waters gathered the waters
together; as the spirit of Christ gathered souls</em>.</p>

<p>The shore is Rockie, with high cliffs, having a multitude
of considerable Harbours; many of which are capacious
enough for a Navy of 500 sail, one of a thousand,
the Countrie within Rockie and mountanious, full of tall
wood, one stately mountain there is surmounting the rest,
about four score mile from the Sea: The description of it
you have in my rarities of <em>New-England</em>, between the
mountains are many ample rich and pregnant valleys as
ever eye beheld, beset on each side with variety of goodly
Trees, the grass man-high unmowed, uneaten and uselesly
withering; within these valleys are spacious lakes
or ponds well stored with Fish and Beavers; the original
of all the great Rivers in the Countrie, of which there are
many with lesser [p. 44.] streams (wherein are an infinite
of fish) manifesting the goodness of the soil which is black,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
red-clay, gravel, sand, loom, and very deep in some places,
as in the valleys and swamps, which are low grounds and
bottoms infinitely thick set with Trees and Bushes of all
sorts for the most part, others having no other shrub or
Tree growing, but spruse, under the shades whereof you
may freely walk two or three mile together; being goodly
large Trees, and convenient for masts and sail-yards. The
whole Countrie produceth springs in abundance replenished
with excellent waters, having all the properties
ascribed to the best in the world.</p>

<p><em>One Spring there is, at</em> Black-point <em>in the Province of</em>

<p>The mountains and Rocky Hills are richly furnished
with mines of Lead, Silver, [p. 45.] Copper, Tin, and divers
sorts of minerals, branching out even to their summits,
where in small Crannies you may meet with threds
of perfect silver; yet have the <em>English</em> no maw to open
any of them, whether out of ignorance or fear of bringing
a forraign Enemy upon them, or (like the dog in the
manger) to keep their Soveraign from partaking of the
benefits, who certainly may claim an interest in them as
his due, being eminently a gift proceeding from
divine bounty to him; no person can pretend interest
in Gold, Silver, or Copper by the law of Nations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
but the Soveraign Prince; but the subjects of our King
have a right to mines discovered in their own Lands and
inheritances; So as that every tenth Tun of such Oar is
to be paid to the proprietors of such lands, and not to the
state, if it be not a mine-Royal: if it prove to be a mine-Royal,
every fifth Tun of all such Oar as shall hold Gold
or Silver worth refining, is to be rendered to the King.
<em>The learned Judges of our Kingdom have long since concluded,
that although the Gold or Silver conteined in the
base mettals of a mine in the land of a Subject, be of less
value than the baser mettal; yet if the Gold or Silver do
countervail the charge of refining it, or be more worth than
the base mettal spent</em> [p. 46.] <em>in refining it, that then it is
a mine-Royal, and as well the base mettal as the Gold and
Silver in it belongs by prerogative to the Crown.</em></p>

<p>The stones in the Countrey are for the most <em>mettle</em>-stone,
free-stone, pebble, slate, none that will run to lime,
of which they have great want, of the slate you may make
Tables easie to be split to the thickness of an inch, or
thicker if you please, and long enough for a dozen men to

onely let me add this observation by the way, that Crystal
set in the Sun taketh fire, and setteth dry Tow or brown
Paper on fire held to it. There is likewise a sort of glittering
sand, which is altogether as good as the glassie
powder brought from the <em>Indies</em> to dry up Ink on paper
newly written. The climate is reasonably temperate,
hotter in Summer, and colder in Winter than with us,
agrees with our Constitutions better than <em>hotter Climates,
these are limbecks to our bodies, forraign heat will extract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the inward and adventitious heat consume the natural, so
much more heat any man receives outwardly from the heat
of the Sun, so much more wants he the same inwardly</em>,
which is one reason why [p. 47.] they are able to receive
more and larger draughts of Brandy, &amp; the like strong
spirits than in <em>England</em> without offence. <em>Cold is less tolerable
than heat, this a friend to nature, that an enemy.
Many are of opinion that the greatest enemies of life, consisting
of heat and moisture, is cold and dryness; the extremity
of cold is more easie to be endured than extremity of
heat; the violent sharpness of winter, than the fiery raging
of Summer. To conclude, they are both bad, too much heat
brings a hot Feaver, too much cold diminisheth the flesh,
withers the face, hollowes the eyes, quencheth natural heat,
peeleth the hair, and procureth baldness.</em></p>

<p>Astronomers have taken special knowledge of the number
of 1024 of the principal apparent noted Stars of all
the rest, besides the 7 Planets, and the 12 Signs, and it is
agreed upon that there are more Stars under the Northern-pole,
than under the Southern, the number of Stars
under both poles are innumerable to us; but not to the
Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth, who calleth them
all by their names. <em>Isai.</em> 40. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Levate in excelsum oculos

<p>In the year 1664. a Star or Comet appeared in <em>New-England</em>
in <em>December</em> in the <em>South-East</em>, rising constantly
about one of the clock in the morning, carrying the tail
lower and lower till it came into the <em>West</em>, and then bare
it directly before it; the Star it self was of a duskish red,
the tail of the colour of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via lactea</i>, or the milkie way. A
fortnight after it appeared again rising higher near the
<em>Nadir</em> or point over our heads, of the same form and colour;
of which hear the former Scholar.</p>

<p><em>Comets (say Naturalists) proceed from natural causes,
but they oft proceed preternatural effects. That they have
been Antecedents to strange consequents is an universal
truth, and proved by particulars</em>, viz. <em>That which hung
over</em> Hierusalem <em>before its extirpation by</em> Vespatian, <em>that
vertical to</em> Germany, <em>before those bloudy Wars</em> &amp;c. <em>So that

between Cometæidæ, which are</em> [p. 51.] <em>Sublunary exhalations,

that is probable of all, which has been observed of some,
that it’s alwayes opposite to the Sun; hence when the Sun

<p>A friend of mine shewed me a small Treatise written
and printed in the <em>Massachusets</em>-Bay by <em>B. D. Intituled
An Astronomical description of the late Comet, or Blazing-Star,
as it appeared in</em> New-England <em>in the Ninth, Tenth,
Eleventh, and the beginning of the Twelfth moneth</em>, 1664.
<em>printed at</em> Cambridge <em>by</em> Samuel Green 1665. An ingenious
piece, but because I could not perswade [p. 53.] my
friend to part with it, I took out some short notes being
straitned in time, which are as followes.</p>

<p>Comets are distinguished in respect of their figure, according
to the divers aspects of the Sun, into <em>Barbate</em>,
<em>Caudate</em>, and <em>Crinite</em>. 1. When the stream like a beard
goes before the body. 2. When the stream followes the
body. 3. When the stream goes right up into the
Heavens.</p>

<p>A Comet is said to be Vertical to any people, when the
body of the Comet passeth over their heads.</p>

<p>The light of the Comet alters and varies according to
the diverse Aspects of the Sun enlightning it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>Some took notice of it in the beginning of <em>November</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1668. <em>July</em> the Fifteenth happened an
Eclipse of the moon from 9 of the clock at night, till after
11, digits 9, and 35 minutes.</p>

<p>In <em>November</em> following appeared a Star between the
horns of the Moon in the midst.</p>

<p>In <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1669. about the middle of <em>June</em> at 4 of
the clock in the afternoon, appeared a Rain-bow reverst,
and at night about 10 of the clock we had a <em>Lunar</em> Rain-bow.</p>

<p>[p. 54.] The <em>Indians</em> so far as I could perceive have but
little knowledge of the Stars and Planets, observing the
Sun and Moon only, the dividers of time into dayes and
years: they being nearer to the Equinoctial-line by 10
degrees, have their dayes and nights more equally divided,
being in Summer two hours shorter, in Winter two
hours longer than they are in <em>England</em>. The 11 of <em>June</em>
the Sun riseth at 4 and 26 minutes, and setteth at 7 &amp; 34
minutes: in <em>December</em>, the 13 the shortest day, the Sun
riseth at 7 and 35 minutes, and setteth at 4 and 27 minutes.</p>

<p>Mid-<em>March</em> their Spring begins, in <em>April</em> they have
Rain and Thunder; So again at <em>Michaelmas</em>, about which
season they have either before <em>Michaelmas</em> or after outrageous
storms of Wind and Rain. It’s observable that
there is no part of the World, which hath not some certain
times of out-rageous storms. We have upon our Coast
in <em>England</em> a <em>Michaelmas</em> flaw, that seldom fails: in the
<em>West-Indies</em> in <em>August</em> and <em>September</em> the forcible <em>North</em>-wind,
which though some call <em>Tuffins</em> or <em>Hurricanes</em> we
must distinguish, for a right <em>Hurricane</em> is (as I have said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
before) an impetuous wind that goes about the Compass
in the space of 24 hours, in such a storm the Lord <em>Willoughby</em>
[p. 55.] of <em>Parham</em> Governour of the <em>Barbadoes</em>
was cast away, going with a fleet to recover St. <em>Christophers</em>
from the <em>French</em>, <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1666. <em>July</em>. Cold
weather begins with the middle of <em>November</em>, the winter’s
perpetually freezing, insomuch that their Rivers and salt-Bayes
are frozen over and passable for Men, Horse, Oxen
and Carts: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æquore cum gelido zephyrus fere xenia Cymbo</i>.
The <em>North-west</em> wind is the sharpest wind in the Countrie.
In <em>England</em> most of the cold winds and weathers come
from the Sea, and those seats that are nearest the Sea-coasts
in <em>England</em> are accounted unwholsome, but not so
in <em>New-England</em>, for in the extremity of winter the <em>North-East</em>
and <em>South</em>-wind coming from the Sea produceth
warm weather, only the <em>North-West</em>-wind coming over
land from the white mountains (which are alwayes (except
in <em>August</em>) covered with snow) is the cause of extream cold
weather, alwayes accompanied with deep snowes and bitter
frosts, the snow for the most part four and six foot deep,
which melting on the superficies with the heat of the Sun,
(for the most part shining out clearly every day) and freezing
again in the night makes a crust upon the snow sufficient
to bear a man walking with snow-shoos upon it.
And at this [p. 56.] season the <em>Indians</em> go forth on hunting
of Dear and Moose, twenty, thirty, forty miles up into
the Countrie. Their Summer is hot and dry proper for
their <em>Indian</em> Wheat; which thrives best in a hot and dry
season, the skie for the most part Summer and Winter very
clear and serene; if they see a little black cloud in the
<em>North-West</em>, no bigger than a man may cover with his Hat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
they expect a following storm, the cloud in short time spreading
round about the Horizon accompanied with violent
gusts of wind, rain, and many times lightning and terrible
thunder. In all Countries they have observations how the
weather will fall out, and these rules following are observable
in <em>New-England</em>. If the Moon look bright and
fair, look for fair weather, also the appearing of one Rainbow
after a storm, is a known sign of fair weather; if mists
come down from the Hills, or descend from the Heavens,
and settle in the valleys, they promise fair hot weather;
mists in the Evening shew a fair hot day on the morrow:
the like when mists rise from waters in the Evening. The
obscuring of the smaller Stars is a certain sign of Tempests
approaching; the oft changing of the wind is also a
fore-runner of a storm; the resounding of the Sea from
the shore, and murmuring of [p. 57.] the winds in the
woods without apparent wind, sheweth wind to follow:
shooting of the Stars (as they call it) is an usual sign of
wind from that quarter the Star came from. So look
whether the resounding of the Sea upon the shore be on
the <em>East</em> or <em>West</em> side of the dwelling, out of that quarter
will the wind proceed the next day. The redness of the
sky in the morning, is a token of winds, or rain or both:
if the Circles that appear about the Sun be red and broken,
they portend wind; if thick and dark, wind, snow and
rain; the like may be said of the Circles about the moon.
If two rain-bowes appear, they are a sign of rain; If the
Sun or Moon look pale, look for rain: if a dark cloud be
at Sun-rising, in which the Sun soon after is hid, it will
dissolve it, and rain will follow; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nebula ascendens indicat
imbres, nebula descendens serenitatem</i>. If the Sun seem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
greater in the <em>East</em>, than in the <em>West</em> about Sun-setting,
and that there appears a black cloud, you may expect rain
that night, or the day following.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>[p. 58.] To conclude; if the white hills look clear and
conspicuous, it is a sign of fair weather; if black and
cloudy, of rain; if yellow, it is a certain sign of snow
shortly to ensue.</p>

<p>In <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1667. <em>March</em>, appeared a sign in the
Heavens in the form of a Sphear, pointing directly to the
<em>West</em>: and in the year following on the third day of <em>April</em>
being <em>Friday</em>, there was a terrible Earthquake, before that
a very great one in 1638. and another in 58 and in 1662/3.
<em>January</em> 26, 27, &amp; 28. (which was the year before I came
thither) there were Earthquakes 6 or 7 times in the space
of three dayes. Earthquakes are frequent in the Countrie;
some suppose that the white mountains were first
raised by Earthquakes, they are hollow as may be guessed
by the resounding of the rain upon the level on the top.
The <em>Indians</em> told us of a River whose course was not only
stopt by an Earthquake in 1668. (as near as I can remember)
but the whole River swallowed up. And I have
heard it reported from credible persons, that (whilst I was
there in the Countrie) there happened a terrible Earthquake
amongst the <em>French</em>, rending a huge Rock asunder
even to the center, wherein was a vast hollow of an immeasurable
depth, out of which came many infernal Spirits.
I shall [p. 59.] conclude this discourse of Earthquakes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
with that which came from the Pen of our Royal Martyr
King <em>Charles</em> the First; <em>A storm at Sea wants not its terrour,
but an Earthquake, shaking the very foundation of
all, the World hath nothing more of horrour.</em> And now I
come to the plants of the Countrie.</p>

<p>The plants in <em>New-England</em> for the variety, number,
beauty, and vertues, may stand in Competition with the
plants of any Countrey in Europe. <em>Johnson</em> hath added
to <em>Gerard’s</em> Herbal 300. and <em>Parkinson</em> mentioneth many
more; had they been in <em>New-England</em> they might have
found 1000 at least never heard of nor seen by any <em>Englishman</em>
before: ’Tis true, the Countrie hath no <em>Bonerets</em>,
or <em>Tartarlambs</em>, no glittering coloured <em>Tuleps</em>; but here
you have the <em>American Mary-Gold</em>, the <em>Earth-nut</em> bearing
a princely Flower, the beautiful leaved <em>Pirola</em>, the
honied <em>Colibry</em>, &amp;c. They are generally of (somewhat) a
more masculine vertue, than any of the same species in
<em>England</em>, but not in so terrible a degree, as to be mischievous
or ineffectual to our <em>English</em> bodies. <em>It is affirmed
by some that no forraign Drugg or Simple can be so proper
to Englishmen as their own, for the quantity of</em> Opium
<em>which Turks do safely take will kill four Englishmen, and
that which will</em> [p. 60.] <em>salve their wounds within a day,
will not recure an Englishman in three.</em> To which I
answer that it is custom that brings the <em>Turks</em> to the familiar
use of <em>Opium</em>. You may have heard of a <em>Taylor</em>
in <em>Kent</em>, who being afflicted with want of sleep ventured
upon <em>Opium</em>, taking at first a grain, and increasing of it
till it came to an ounce, which quantitie he took as familiarly
as a <em>Turk</em>, without any harm, more than that he
could not sleep without it. The <em>English</em> in <em>New-England</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
take white <em>Hellebore</em>, which operates as fairly with them,
as with the <em>Indians</em>, who steeping of it in water sometime,
give it to young lads gathered together a purpose to drink,
if it come up they force them to drink again their vomit,
(which they save in a Birchen-dish) till it stayes with them,
&amp; he that gets the victory of it is made Captain of the
other lads for that year. There is a plant likewise, called
for want of a name <em>Clownes wound wort</em> by the <em>English</em>,
though it be not the same, that will heal a green wound
in 24 hours, if a wise man have the ordering of it. Thus
much for the general, I shall now begin to discover unto
you the plants more particularly, and I shall first begin
with Trees, and of them, first with such as are called in
Scripture Trees of God, that is great [p. 61.] Trees, that
grow of themselves without planting. Psal. 104. 16, 17.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Satiantur arbores Jehovæ</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cedri Libani quas plantavit</i>;
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi aviculæ nidificent</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abietes domicilia ciconiæ</i>. The
Herons take great delight to sit basking upon the tops of
these Trees. And I shall not be over large in any, having
written of them in my Treatise of the rarities of <em>New-England</em>,
to which I refer you.</p>

<p>The <em>Oake</em> I have given you an account of, and the
kinds; I shall add the ordering of Red <em>Oake</em> for Wainscot.
When they have cut it down and clear’d it from the
branches, they pitch the body of the Tree in a muddy
place in a River, with the head downward for some time,
afterwards they draw it out, and when it is seasoned sufficiently,
they saw it into boards for Wainscot, and it will
branch out into curious works.</p>

<p>There is an admirable rare Creature in shape like a
<em>Buck</em>, with Horns, of a gummy substance, which I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
often found in the fall of the leaf upon the ground amongst
the withered leaves; a living Creature I cannot call it;
having only the sign of a mouth and eyes: seldom or
never shall you meet with any of them whole, but the
head and horns, or the hinder parts, broken off from the
rest; the <em>Indians</em> call them Tree <em>Bucks</em>, and have a superstitious
saying (for I believe [p. 62.] they never see any of
them living) that if they can see a Tree-<em>Buck</em> walking
upon the branches of an <em>Oake</em> when they go out in a
morning to hunt, they shall have good luck that day.
What they are good for I know not, but certainly there is
some more than ordinary vertue in them. It is true that
nothing in nature is superfluous, and we have the Scripture
to back it, that God created nothing in vain. The
like Creatures they <em>have at the</em> Barbadoes <em>which they call</em>
Negroes <em>heads, found in the Sands, about two inches long,
with forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, and part of the neck,
they are alwayes found loose in the Sands without any root,
it is as black as Jet, but whence it comes they know not. I
have read likewise, that in the</em> Canaries <em>or</em> Fortunate-Islands,
<em>there is found a certain Creature, which Boys bring
home from the mountains as oft as they would, and named
them</em> Tudesquels, <em>or little</em> Germans: <em>for they were dry’d
dead Carcases, almost three footed, which any boy did easily
carry in one of the palms of his hand, and they were of an
humane shape; but the whole dead Carcase was clearly like
unto Parchment, and their bones were flexible, as it were
gristles: against the Sun, also, their bowels and intestines
were seen. Surely (saith my Authour) the destroyed race
of the</em> Pigmies <em>was there</em>. There is [p. 63.] also many
times found upon the leaves of the <em>Oake</em> a Creature like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
a <em>Frog</em>, being as thin as a leaf, and transparent, as yellow
as Gold, with little fiery red eyes, the <em>English</em> call them
Tree-frogs or Tree-toads (but of Tree-toads I shall have
occasion to speak in another place) they are said to be venemous,
but may be safely used, being admirable to stop
womens over-flowing courses hung about their necks in a
Taffetie bag.</p>

<p><em>Captain</em> Smith <em>writes that in</em> New-England <em>there
growes a certain berry called</em> Kermes, <em>worth</em> 10 <em>shillings
a pound, and had been formerly sold for</em> 30 <em>or</em> 40 <em>shillings
a pound, which may yearly be gathered in good quantity.</em>
I have sought for this berry, he speaks of, as a man should
seek for a needle in a bottle of Hay, but could never light
upon it; unless that kind of <em>Solomon-seal</em> called by the
<em>English</em> Treacle-berry be it. <em>Gerard</em> our famous Herbalist
<em>writes that they grow upon a little Tree called</em> Scarlet-Oake,
<em>the leaves have one sharp prickle at the end of it; it
beareth small</em> Acorns: <em>But the grain or berry growes out
of the woody branches, like an excrescence of the substance of
the</em> Oake-Apple, <em>and of the bigness of Pease, at first white,
when ripe of an</em> Ash-colour, <em>which ingenders little Maggots,
which when it begins</em> [p. 64.] <em>to have wings are put
into a bag and boulted up and down till dead, and then
made up into lumps, the Maggot as most do deem is</em> Cutchenele;
<em>So that</em> Chermes <em>is</em> Cutchenele: <em>the berries dye
scarlet. Mr.</em> George Sands <em>in his Travels saith (much to
the same purpose) that scarlet dye growes like a blister on the
leaf of the Holy</em> Oake, <em>a little shrub, yet producing</em> Acorns,
<em>being gathered they rub out of it a certain red dust, that
converteth after a while into worms, which they kill with
Wine, when they begin to quicken. See farther concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Treacle-berries and</em> Cutchinele <em>in the rarities of</em> New-England.</p>

<p>The Pine-Tree challengeth the next place, and that
sort which is called Board-pine is the principal, it is a
stately large Tree, very tall, and sometimes two or three
fadom about: of the body the <em>English</em> make large <em>Canows</em>
of 20 foot long, and two foot and a half over, hollowing
of them with an Adds, and shaping of the outside like a
Boat. Some conceive that the wood called <em>Gopher</em> in
Scripture, of which <em>Noah</em> made the Ark, was no other
than Pine, <em>Gen.</em> 6. 14. The bark thereof is good for
Ulcers in tender persons that refuse sharp medicines.
The inner bark of young board-pine cut small and stampt
and boiled in a Gallon of water is a very soveraign medicine
for burn [p. 65.] or scald, washing the sore with some
of the decoction, and then laying on the bark stampt very
soft: or for frozen limbs, to take out the fire and to heal
them, take the bark of Board-pine-Tree, cut it small and
stamp it and boil it in a gallon of water to Gelly, wash the
sore with the liquor, stamp the bark again till it be very
soft and bind it on. The Turpentine is excellent to heal
wounds and cuts, and hath all the properties of <em>Venice</em>
Turpentine, the Rosen is as good as Frankincense, and
the powder of the dryed leaves generateth flesh; the distilled
water of the green Cones taketh away wrinkles in
the face being laid on with Cloths.</p>

<p>The Firr-tree is a large Tree too, but seldom so big as
the Pine, the bark is smooth, with knobs or blisters, in
which lyeth clear liquid Turpentine very good to be put
into salves and oyntments, the leaves or Cones boiled in
Beer are good for the Scurvie, the young buds are excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
to put into Epithemes for Warts and Corns, the
Rosen is altogether as good as Frankincense; out of this
Tree the Poleakers draw Pitch and Tarr; the manner I
shall give you, for that it may (with many other things
contained in this Treatise) be beneficial to my Countrymen,
either there already seated, or that [p. 66.] may happen
to go thither hereafter. Out of the fattest wood
changed into Torch-wood, which is a disease in that Tree,
they draw Tarr, first a place must be paved with stone or
the like, a little higher in the middle, about which there
must be made gutters, into which the liquor falls, then out
from them other gutters are to be drawn, by which it may
be received, then is it put into barrels. The place thus
prepared, the cloven wood must be set upright, then must
it be covered with a great number of firr and pitch bowes;
and on every part all about with much lome and sods of
earth, and great heed must be taken, lest there be any cleft
or chink remaining, only a hole left in the top of the furnace,
through which the fire may be put in, and the flame
and smoak to pass out: when the fire burneth, the Pitch
or Tarr runneth forth first thin and then thicker; of which
when it is boiled is made Pitch: the powder of dried
Pitch is used to generate flesh in wounds and sores. The
knots of this Tree and fat-pine are used by the <em>English</em>
instead of Candles, and it will burn a long time, but it
makes the people pale.</p>

<p>The Spruce-tree I have given you an account of in my
<em>New-England</em> rarities. In the North-east of <em>Scotland</em>
upon the banks [p. 67.] of <em>Lough-argick</em>, there hath been
formerly of these Trees 28 handful about at the Root, and
their bodies mounted to 90 foot of height, bearing at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
length 20 inches diameter. At <em>Pascataway</em> there is now
a Spruce-tree brought down to the water-side by our
Mass-men of an incredible bigness, and so long that no
Skipper durst ever yet adventure to ship it, but there it
lyes and Rots.</p>

<p>The Hemlock-tree is a kind of spruce or pine; the bark
boiled and stampt till it be very soft is excellent for to heal
wounds, and so is the Turpentine thereof, and the Turpentine
that issueth from the Cones of the Larch-tree,
(which comes nearest of any to the right Turpentine) is
singularly good to heal wounds, and to draw out the malice
(or Thorn, as <em>Helmont</em> phrases it) of any Ach, rubbing
the place therewith, and strowing upon it the powder of
<em>Sage</em>-leaves.</p>

<p>The white Cedar is a stately Tree, and is taken by some
to be <em>Tamarisk</em>, this Tree the <em>English</em> saw into boards to
floor their Rooms, for which purpose it is excellent, long
lasting, and wears very smooth and white; likewise they
make shingles to cover their houses with instead of tyle, it
will never warp. This Tree, the Oak and the [p. 68.]
Larch-tree are best for building. Groundsels made of
Larch-tree will never rot, and the longer it lyes the harder
it growes, that you may almost drive a nail into a bar of
Iron as easily as into that. Oh, that my Countreymen
might obtain that blessing with their buildings, which
<em>Esay</em> prophesied to the <em>Jewes</em> in the 65 Chapter and 22
verse. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non ædificabunt &amp; alius inhabitabit, non plantabunt
&amp; alius comedet: sed ut sunt dies Arboris, dies erunt
populi mei, &amp; opus manuum suarum deterent electi mei.</i></p>

<p>The Sassafras-tree is no great Tree, I have met with
some as big as my middle, the rind is tawny and upon that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
a thin colour of Ashes, the inner part is white, of an excellent
smell like Fennel, of a sweet tast with some bitterness;
the leaves are like Fig-leaves of a dark green. A
decoction of the Roots and bark thereof sweetned with
Sugar, and drunk in the morning fasting will open the
body and procure a stool or two, it is good for the Scurvie
taken some time together, and laying upon the legs
the green leaves of white <em>Hellebore</em>. They give it to Cows
that have newly calved to make them cast their Cleanings.
This Tree growes not beyond <em>Black-point</em> Eastward: it is
observed, that there is no province but produces Trees
and plants not growing in other Regions.</p>


<p class="noindent">[p. 69.] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non omnis fert omnia tellus.</i></p>

<p>The Walnut which is divers, some bearing square nuts,
others like ours, but smaller: there is likewise black Walnut
of precious use for Tables, Cabinets and the like.
The Walnut-tree is the toughest wood in the Countrie,
and therefore made use of for Hoops and Bowes, there
being no Yew there growing; In <em>England</em> they made
their Bowes usually of Witch Hasel, Ash, Yew, the best
of outlandish Elm, but the <em>Indians</em> make theirs of Walnut.</p>

<p>The Line-tree with long nuts, the other kind I could
never find: the wood of this Tree, Laurel, Rhamnus,
Holly and Ivy are accounted for woods that cause fire by
attrition; Laurel and Ivy are not growing in <em>New-England</em>:
the <em>Indians</em> will rub two sear’d sticks of any sort of
wood, and kindle a fire with them presently.</p>

<p>The Maple-tree, on the boughs of this Tree I have often
found a jellied substance like <em>Jewes-Ears</em>, which I found
upon tryal to be as good for sore throats <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>The Birch-tree is of two kinds, ordinary Birch, and
black Birch, many of these Trees are stript of their bark
by the <em>Indians</em>, who make of it their Canows, Kettles, [p.
70.] and Birchen-dishes: there is an excrescence growing
out of the body of the Tree called spunck, or dead mens
Caps, it growes at the Roots of Ash, or Beech, or Elm;
but the best is that which growes upon the black Birch,
this boiled and beaten, and then dried in an Oven maketh
excellent Touch-wood, and Balls to play with.</p>

<p>Alder, of which wood there is abundance in the wet
swamps: the bark thereof with the yolke of an Egg is
good for a strain; an <em>Indian</em> bruising of his knee, chew’d
the bark of Alder fasting and laid it to, which quickly
helped him. The wives of our West-Countrey English
make a drink with the seeds of Alder, giving it to their
Children troubled with the <em>Alloes</em>. I have talk’d with
many of them, but could never apprehend what disease it
should be they so name, these Trees are called by some
Sullinges.</p>

<p>The <em>Indians</em> tell of a Tree that growes far up in the
land, that is as big as an Oake, that will cure the falling-sickness
infallibly, what part thereof they use, Bark, Wood,
leaves or fruit, I could never learn; they promised often
to bring of it to me, but did not. I have seen a stately
Tree growing here and there in valleys, not like to any
Trees in Europe, having a smooth bark of [p. 71.] a dark
brown colour, the leaves like great Maple, in <em>England</em>
called Sycamor, but larger, it may be this is the Tree they
brag of.</p>

<p>Thus much concerning Trees, now I shall present to
your view the Shrubs; and first of the Sumach Shrub,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
which as I have told you in <em>New-Englands</em> rarities, differeth
from all the kinds set down in our <em>English</em> Herbals;
the root dyeth wool or cloth reddish, the decoction
of the leaves in wine drunk, is good for all Fluxes of the
belly in man or woman, the whites, <em>&amp;c.</em> For galled
places stamp the leaves with honey, and apply it, nothing
so soon healeth a wound in the head as Sumach stampt and
applyed once in three dayes, the powder strewed in stayeth
the bleeding of wounds: The seed of Sumach pounded and
mixt with honey, healeth the Hemorrhoids, the gum put
into a hollow tooth asswageth the pain, the bark or berries
in the fall of the leaf, is as good as galls to make Ink of.</p>

<p>Elder in <em>New-England</em> is shrubbie, &amp; dies once in two
years: there is a sort of dwarf-Elder that growes by the
Sea-side that hath a red pith, the berries of both are
smaller than <em>English</em>-Elder, not round but corner’d, neither
of them smell so strong as ours.</p>

<p>Juniper growes for the most part by the Sea-side, it
bears abundance of skie-coloured [p. 72.] berries fed upon
by Partridges, and hath a woodie root, which induceth me
to believe that the plant mention’d in Job 30. 4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui
decerpebant herbas é salsilagine cum stirpibus: etiam radices
Juniperorum cibo erant illis</i>, was our <em>Indian</em> plant
<em>Cassava</em>. They write that <em>Juniper</em>-coals preserve fire
longest of any, keeping fire a whole year without supply,
yet the <em>Indian</em> never burns of it.</p>

<p>Sweet fern, see the rarities of <em>New England</em>, the tops
and nucaments of sweet fern boiled in water or milk and
drunk helpeth all manner of Fluxes, being boiled in water
it makes an excellent liquor for Inck.</p>

<p>Current-bushes are of two kinds red and black, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
black currents which are larger than the red smell like
cats piss, yet are reasonable pleasant in eating.</p>

<p>The Gooseberry-bush, the berry of which is called Grosers
or thorn Grapes, grow all over the Countrie, the berry
is but small, of a red or purple colour when ripe.</p>

<p>There is a small shrub which is very common, growing
sometimes to the height of Elder, bearing a berry like in
shape to the fruit of the white thorn, of a pale yellow colour
at first, then red, when it is ripe of a deep purple, of
a delicate Aromatical tast, somewhat stiptick: to conclude,
[p. 73.] alwayes observe this rule in taking or refusing
unknown fruit: if you find them eaten of the fowl or
beast, you may boldly venture to eat of them, otherwise do
not touch them.</p>

<p><em>Maze</em>, otherwise called <em>Turkie</em>-wheat, or rather <em>Indian</em>-wheat,
because it came first from thence; the leaves
boiled and drunk helpeth pain in the back; of the stalks
when they are green you may make <em>Beverage</em>, as they do
with <em>Calamels</em>, or Sugar-canes. The raw Corn chewed
ripens felons or Cats hairs, or you may lay Samp to it:
The <em>Indians</em> before it be thorow ripe eat of it parched.
Certainly the parched corn that <em>Abigail</em> brought to <em>David</em>
was of this kind of grain, 1 Sam. 25. 18. <em>The Jewes
manner was (as it is delivered to us by a learned Divine)
first to parch their Corn, then they fryed it, and lastly they
boiled it to a paste, and then tempered it with water, Cheese-Curds,
Honey and Eggs, this they carried drye with them
to the Camp, and so wet the Cakes in Wine or milk; such
was the pulse too of</em> Africa.</p>

<p><em>French</em>-beans, or rather <em>American</em>-beans, the Herbalists
call them kidney-beans from their shape and effects, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
they strengthen the kidneys; they are variegated much,
some being bigger a great deal than others; some [p. 74.]
white, black, red, yellow, blew, spotted; besides your
<em>Bonivis</em> and <em>Calavances</em> and the kidney-bean, that is
proper to <em>Ronoake</em>, but these are brought into the Countrie,
the other are natural to the climate. So the <em>Mexico</em>
pompion which is flat and deeply camphered, the flesh
laid to, asswageth pain of the eyes. The water-mellon is
proper to the Countrie, the flesh of it is of a flesh colour,
a rare cooler of Feavers, and excellent against the stone.
<em>Pomum spinosum</em> and <em>palma-Christi</em> too growes not here,
unless planted, brought from <em>Peru</em>; the later is thought
to be the plant, that shaded Jonah <em>the Prophet</em>, Jonas 4. 6.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paraverat enim</i> Jehova <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus ricinum qui ascenderet supra</i>
Jonam, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut esset umbra super caput ejus ereptura eum à
malo ipsius; lætabaturque</i> Jonas <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de ricino illo lætitia
magna</i>. <em>Ricinum</em>, that is <em>palma Christi</em>, called also <em>cucurbita</em>,
and therefore translated a Gourd.</p>

<p>Tobacco, or <em>Tabacca</em> so called from <em>Tabaco</em> or <em>Tabago</em>,
one of the <em>Caribbe</em>-Islands about 50 <em>English</em> miles from
<em>Trinidad</em>. The right name, according to <em>Monardus</em>, is
<em>picielte</em>, as others will <em>petum</em>, <em>nicotian</em> from <em>Nicot</em>, a Portingal,
to whom it was presented for a raritie in <em>Anno
Dom.</em> 1559. by one that brought it from <em>Florida</em>. Great
contest there is about the time when it was first [p. 75.]
brought into <em>England</em>, some will have Sir <em>John Hawkins</em>
the first, others Sir <em>Francis Drake’s</em> Mariners; others
again say that one Mr. <em>Lane</em> imployed by Sir <em>Walter Rawleigh</em>
brought it first into England; all conclude that Sir
<em>Walter Rawleigh</em> brought it first in use. <em>It is observed that
no one kind of forraign Commodity yieldeth greater advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
to the publick than Tobacco, it is generally made the
complement of our entertainment, and hath made more
slaves than</em> Mahomet. There is three sorts of it Marchantable,
the first horse Tobacco, having a broad long
leaf piked at the end; the second round pointed Tobacco;
third sweet scented Tobacco. These are made up into
Cane, leaf or ball; there is little of it planted in <em>New-England</em>,
neither have they learned the right way of curing
of it. It is sowen in <em>April</em> upon a bed of rich mould
sifted, they make a bed about three yards long, or more
according to the ground they intend to plant, and a yard
and a half over; this they tread down hard, then they sow
their seed upon it as thick as may be, and sift fine earth
upon it, then tread it down again as hard as possible they
can, when it hath gotten four or six leaves, they remove it
into the planting ground; when it begins to bud towards
flowring, they crop off the [p. 76.] top, for the Flower
drawes away the strength of the leaf. For the rest I refer
you to the Planter, being not willing to discover their
mysteries. The <em>Indians</em> in <em>New-England</em> use a small
round leafed Tobacco, called by them, or the Fishermen
Poke. <em>It is odious to the</em> English. <em>The vertues of Tobacco
are these, it helps digestion, the Gout, the Tooth-ach,
prevents infection by scents, it heats the cold, and cools them
that sweat, feedeth the hungry, spent spirits restoreth, purgeth
the stomach, killeth nits and lice; the juice of the green
leaf healeth green wounds, although poysoned; the Syrup
for many diseases, the smoak for the Phthisick, cough of the
lungs, distillations of Rheume, and all diseases of a cold
and moist cause, good for all bodies cold and moist taken
upon an emptie stomach, taken upon a full stomach it precipitates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
digestion, immoderately taken it dryeth the body,
enflameth the bloud, hurteth the brain, weakens the eyes and
the sinews.</em></p>

<p>White <em>Hellebore</em> is used for the Scurvie by the <em>English</em>.
A friend of mine gave them first a purge, then conserve
of Bear-berries, then fumed their leggs with vinegar,
sprinkled upon a piece of mill-stone made hot, and applied
to the sores white <em>Hellebore</em> leaves; drink made of
<em>Orpine</em> and <em>sorrel</em> were given likewise with it, and [p. 77.]
Sea-scurvie-grass. To kill lice, boil the roots of <em>Hellebore</em>
in milk, and anoint the hair of the head therewith or
other places.</p>

<p><em>Mandrake</em>, is a very rare plant, the <em>Indians</em> know it not,
it is found in the woods about <em>Pascataway</em>, they do in
plain terms stink, therefore <em>Reubens</em> Flowers that he
brought home were not <em>Mandrakes</em>, Gen. 30. 14, 15, 16.
<em>They are rendered in the Latine</em> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amabiles flores</span>, <em>the same
word say our Divines is used in</em> Canticles, 7. 4. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amabiles
istos flores edentes odorem, &amp; secundum ostia nostra
omnes pretiosos fructus, recentes simulac veteres, dilecte
mi, repono tibi.</span> <em>So that the right translation is</em>, Reuben
<em>brought home amiable and sweet smelling Flowers; this in
the</em> Canticles (<em>say they</em>) <em>expounding the other</em>.</p>

<p><em>Calamus Aromaticus</em>, or the sweet smelling reed, it
Flowers in <em>July</em>; see <em>New-Englands</em> rarities.</p>

<p><em>Sarsaparilla</em> or roughbind-weed (as some describe it)
the leaves and whole bind set with thorns, of this there is
store growing upon the banks of Ponds. See the rarities
of <em>New-England</em>. The leaves of the <em>Sarsaparilla</em> there
described pounded with Hogs grease and boiled to an
unguent, is excellent in the curing of wounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Live for ever, it is a kind of <em>Cud-weed</em>, [p. 78.] flourisheth
all summer long till cold weather comes in, it growes
now plentifully in our <em>English</em> Gardens, it is good for
cough of the lungs, and to cleanse the breast taken as you
do Tobacco; and for pain in the head the decoction, or
the juice strained and drunk in Bear, Wine, or Aqua
vitæ, killeth worms. The Fishermen when they want
Tobacco take this herb being cut and dryed.</p>

<p><em>Lysimachus</em> or Loose-strife: there are several kinds, but
the most noted is the yellow <em>Lysimachus</em> of <em>Virginia</em>, the
root is longish and white, as thick as ones thumb, the
stalkes of an overworn colour, and a little hairie, the middle
vein of the leaf whitish, the Flower yellow and like
Primroses, and therefore called Tree-primrose, growes
upon seedie vessels, <em>&amp;c.</em> The first year it growes not up
to a stalke, but sends up many large leaves handsomely
lying one upon another, Rose fashion, Flowers in <em>June</em>, the
seed is ripe in <em>August</em>, this as I have said is taken by the
<em>English</em> for Scabious.</p>

<p>St. <em>John’s</em> wort, it preserveth Cheese made up in it, at Sea.</p>

<p>Spurge or Wolfes milch there are several sorts.</p>

<p><em>Avens</em>, or herb-bennet; you have an account of it in
<em>New-Englands</em> rarities, but one [p. 79.] thing more I
shall add, that you may plainly perceive a more masculine
quality in the plants growing in <em>New-England</em>. A
neighbour of mine in Hay-time, having overheat himself,
and melted his grease, with striving to outmowe another
man, fell dangerously sick, not being able to turn himself
in his bed, his stomach gon, and his heart fainting ever
and anon; to whom I administered the decoction of <em>Avens</em>-Roots
and leaves in water and wine, sweetning it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Syrup of Clove-Gilliflowers, in one weeks time it recovered
him, so that he was able to perform his daily work,
being a poor planter or husbandman as we call them.</p>

<p>Red-Lilly growes all over the Countrey amongst the
bushes. Mr. <em>Johnson</em> upon <em>Gerard</em> takes the Tulip to be
the Lilly of the field mentioned by our Saviour, Matth.
6. 28, 29. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ac de vestitu quid soliciti estis? discite quomodo
lilia agrorum augescant: non fatigantur, neque nent, sed
dico vobis, ne Solomonem quidem cum universa gloria sic
amictum fuisse ut unum ex istis.</i> Solomon <em>in all his Royalty
was not like one of them. His reasons are, first from
the shape, like a lilly; The second, because those places where
our Saviour was conversant they grow wild in the fields.
Third, the infinite variety of the</em> [p. 80.] <em>colours. The
fourth and last reason, the wondrous beautie and mixture
of these Flowers.</em></p>

<p>Water-lillys; the black roots dryed and pulverized, are
wondrous effectual in the stopping of all manner of fluxes
of the belly, drunk with wine or water.</p>

<p><em>Herba-paris</em>, one berry, herb true love, or four-leaved
night-shade, the leaves are good to be laid upon hot
tumours.</p>

<p><em>Umbilicus veneris</em>, or <em>New-England</em> daisie, it is good for
hot humours, <em>Erisipelas</em>, St. <em>Anthonie’s</em> fire, all inflammations.</p>

<p><em>Glass-wort</em>, a little quantity of this plant you may take
for the Dropsie, but be very careful that you take not too
much, for it worketh impetuously.</p>

<p>Water-plantane, called in <em>New-England</em> water Suck-leaves,
and Scurvie-leaves, you must lay them whole to the
leggs to draw out water between the skin and the flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p><em>Rosa-solis</em>, Sun-dew, moor-grass, this plant I have seen
more of, than ever I saw in my whole life before in <em>England</em>,
a man may gather upon some marish-grounds an
incredible quantity in a short time; towards the middle
of <em>June</em> it is in its season, for then its spear is shot out to
its length, of which they take hold and pull the whole
plant up by the roots from the moss with ease.</p>

<p>[p. 81.] <em>Amber</em>-greese I take to be a Mushroom, see the
rarities of <em>New-England</em>. Monardus <em>writeth that</em> Amber<em>-greese
riseth out of a certain clammy and bituminous earth
under the Seas, and by the Sea-side, the billows casting up
part of it a land, and fish devour the rest; Some say it is
the seed of a Whale, others, that it springeth from fountains
as pitch doth, which fishes swallow down; the air congealeth
it.</em> And sometimes it is found in the crevises and corners
of Rocks.</p>

<p><em>Fuss-balls</em>, <em>Mullipuffes</em> called by the Fishermen Wolves-farts,
are to be found plentifully, and those bigger by
much than any I have seen in <em>England</em>.</p>

<p><em>Coraline</em> there is infinite store of it cast upon the shore,
and another plant that is more spinie, of a Red colour,
and as hard as Corral. <em>Coraline</em> laid to the gout easeth
the pain.</p>

<p>Sea-Oake or wreach, or Sea-weed, the black pouches
of Oar-weed dryed and pulverized, and drunk with White-wine,
is an excellent remedy for the stone.</p>

<p>I will finish this part of my relation concerning plants,
with an admirable plant for the curing and taking away
of Corns, which many times sore troubleth the Traveller:
it is not above a handful high; the little branches are
woodie, the leaves like [p. 82.] the leaves of Box, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
broader and much thicker, hard and of a deep grass-green
colour; this bruised or champt in the mouth and laid
upon the Corn will take it away clean in one night. And
observe all <em>Indian</em> Trees and plants, their Roots are but
of small depth, and so they must be set.</p>

<p>Of Beasts of the earth there be scarce 120 several kinds,
and not much more of the Fowls of the Air, is the opinion
of some Naturalists; there are not many kinds of
Beasts in <em>New-England</em>, they may be divided into Beasts
of the Chase of the stinking foot, as <em>Roes</em>, <em>Foxes</em>, <em>Jaccals</em>,
<em>Wolves</em>, <em>Wild-cats</em>, <em>Raccons</em>, <em>Porcupines</em>, <em>Squncks</em>, <em>Musquashes</em>,
<em>Squirrels</em>, <em>Sables</em>, and <em>Mattrises</em>; and Beasts of
the Chase of the sweet foot, <em>Buck</em>, Red <em>Dear</em>, Rain-<em>Dear</em>,
<em>Elke</em>, <em>Marouse</em>, <em>Maccarib</em>, <em>Bear</em>, <em>Beaver</em>, <em>Otter</em>, <em>Marten</em>,
<em>Hare</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Roe</em> a kind of Deer, and the fleetest Beast upon
earth is here to be found, and is good venison, but not
over fat.</p>

<p>The <em>Fox</em>, the male is called a dog-fox, the female a
bitch-fox, they go a clicketing the beginning of the spring,
and bring forth their Cubs in <em>May</em> and <em>June</em>. There are
two or three kinds of them; one a great yellow <em>Fox</em>, another
grey, who will climb up into Trees; the black <em>Fox</em>
is of much esteem. <em>Foxes</em> and <em>Wolves</em> are usually hunted
[p. 83.] in <em>England</em> from <em>Holy-Rood</em> day, till the <em>Annunciation</em>.
In <em>New-England</em> they make best sport in the
depth of winter; they lay a sledg-load of Cods-heads on
the other side of a paled fence when the moon shines,
and about nine or ten of the clock the <em>Foxes</em> come to it,
sometimes two or three, or half a dozen, and more; these
they shoot, and by that time they have cased them, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
will be as many; So they continue shooting and killing
of <em>Foxes</em> as long as the moon shineth; I have known half
a score kill’d in one night. Their pisles are bonie like a
doggs, their fat liquified and put into the ears easeth the
pain, their tails or bushes are very fair ones and of good
use, but their skins are so thin (yet thick set with deep
furr) that they will hardly hold the dressing.</p>

<p><em>Jaccals</em> there be abundance, which is a Creature much
like a <em>Fox</em>, but smaller, they are very frequent in <em>Palæstina</em>,
or the <em>Holy-land</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Wolf</em> seeketh his mate and goes a clicketing at
the same season with <em>Foxes</em>, and bring forth their whelps
as they do, but their kennels are under thick bushes by
great Trees in remote places by the swamps, he is to be
hunted as the <em>Fox</em> from <em>Holy-rood</em> day till the <em>Annunciation</em>.
But there [p. 84.] they have a quicker way to destroy
them. See <em>New-Englands</em> rarities. They commonly
go in routs, a rout of <em>Wolves</em> is 12 or more, sometimes by
couples. In 1664. we found a <em>Wolf</em> asleep in a small dry
swamp under an Oake, a great mastiff which we had with
us seized upon him, and held him till we had put a rope
about his neck, by which we brought him home, and
tying of him to a stake we bated him with smaller Doggs,
and had excellent sport; but his hinder legg being broken,
they knockt out his brains. Sometime before this we had
an excellent course after a single <em>Wolf</em> upon the hard
sands by the Sea-side at low water for a mile or two, at
last we lost our doggs, it being (as the <em>Lancashire</em> people
phrase it) twi-light, that is almost dark, and went beyond
them, for a mastiff-bitch had seized upon the <em>Wolf</em> being
gotten into the Sea, and there held him, till one went in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and led him out, the bitch keeping her hold till they had
tyed his leggs, and so carried him home like a Calf upon
a staff between two men; being brought into the house
they unbound him and set him upon his leggs, he not
offering in the least to bite, or so much as to shew his
teeth, but clapping his stern betwixt his leggs, and leering
towards the door would willingly have had his liberty,
[p. 85.] but they served him as they did the other, knockt
his brains out, for our doggs were not then in a condition
to bate him; their eyes shine by night as a Lanthorn:
the Fangs of a <em>Wolf</em> hung about childrens necks keep
them from frighting, and are very good to rub their
gums with when they are breeding of Teeth, the gall of a
<em>Wolf</em> is Soveraign for swelling of the sinews; the fiants or
dung of a <em>Wolf</em> drunk with white-wine helpeth the <em>Collick</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Wild-cat</em>, <em>Lusern</em> or <em>luceret</em>, or Ounce as some call
it, is not inferiour to Lamb, their grease is very soveraign
for lameness upon taking cold.</p>

<p>The <em>Racoon</em> or <em>Rattoon</em> is of two sorts, gray <em>Rattoons</em>,
and black <em>Rattoons</em>, their grease is soveraign for wounds
with bruises, aches, streins, bruises; and to anoint after
broken bones and dislocations.</p>

<p>The <em>Squnck</em> is almost as big as a <em>Racoon</em>, perfect black
and white or pye-bald, with a bush-tail like a <em>Fox</em>, an offensive
Carion; the Urine of this Creature is of so strong
a scent, that if it light upon any thing, there is no abiding
of it, it will make a man smell, though he were of <em>Alexanders</em>
complexion; and so sharp that if he do but whisk his
bush which he pisseth upon in the face of a dogg hunting
of him, and that [p. 86.] any of it light in his eyes it
will make him almost mad with the smart thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>The <em>Musquashes</em> is a small Beast that lives in shallow
ponds, where they build them houses of earth and sticks
in shape like mole-hills, and feed upon <em>Calamus Aromaticus</em>:
in <em>May</em> they scent very strong of Muske; their furr
is of no great esteem; their stones wrapt up in Cotten-wool
will continue a long time, and are good to lay
amongst cloths to give them a grateful smell.</p>

<p>The <em>Squirril</em>, of which there are three sorts, the mouse-squirril,
the gray squirril, and the flying squirril, called by
the <em>Indian</em> <em>Assapanick</em>. The mouse-squirril is hardly so
big as a Rat, streak’d on both sides with black and red
streaks, they are mischievous vermine destroying abundance
of Corn both in the field and in the house, where
they will gnaw holes into Chests, and tear clothes both
linnen and wollen, and are notable nut-gathers in <em>August</em>;
when hasel and filbert nuts are ripe you may see
upon every Nut-tree as many mouse-squirrils as leaves;
So that the nuts are gone in a trice, which they convey
to their Drays or Nests. The gray squirril is pretty large,
almost as big as a Conie, and are very good meat: in
some parts of the Countrie there are many of them. The
flying squirril is so called, [p. 87.] because (his skin being
loose and large) he spreads it on both sides like wings
when he passeth from one Tree to another at great distance.
I cannot call it flying nor leaping, for it is both.</p>

<p>The <em>Mattrise</em> is a Creature whose head and fore-parts is
shaped somewhat like a Lyons, not altogether so big as a
house-cat, they are innumerable up in the Countrey, and
are esteemed good furr.</p>

<p>The <em>Sable</em> is much of the size of a <em>Mattrise</em> perfect
black, but what store there is of them I cannot tell, I
never saw but two of them in Eight years space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>The <em>Martin</em> is as ours are in <em>England</em>, but blacker,
they breed in holes which they make in the earth like
Conies, and are innumerable, their skins or furr are in
much request.</p>

<p>The <em>Buck</em>, <em>Stag</em>, and <em>Rain-Dear</em> are Creatures that will
live in the coldest climates, here they are innumerable,
bringing forth three <em>Fawns</em> or <em>Calves</em> at a time, which
they hide a mile asunder to prevent their destruction by
the <em>Wolves</em>, wild-<em>Cats</em>, <em>Bears</em>, and <em>Mequans</em>: when they
are in season they will be very fat; there are but few slain
by the <em>English</em>. The <em>Indians</em> who shoot them, and take
of them with toyls, bring them in [p. 88.] with their suet,
and the bones that grow upon <em>Stags-Hearts</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Moose</em> or <em>Elke</em> is a Creature, or rather if you will
a Monster of superfluity; a full grown <em>Moose</em> is many
times bigger than an <em>English</em> Oxe, their horns as I have
said elsewhere, very big (and brancht out into palms) the
tips whereof are sometimes found to be two fathom asunder,
(a fathom [p. 89.] is six feet from the tip of one finger
to the tip of the other, that is four cubits,) and in height
from the toe of the fore-foot, to the pitch of the shoulder
twelve foot, both which hath been taken by some of my
<em>sceptique</em> Readers to be monstrous lyes. If you consider
the breadth that the beast carrieth, and the magnitude of
the horns, you will be easily induced to contribute your
belief.</p>

<p>What would you say, if I should tell you that in <em>Greenland</em>
there are <em>Does</em> that have as large horns as <em>Bucks</em>,
their brow Antlers growing downwards beyond their
<em>Musles</em>, and broad at the end wherewith they scrape away
the snow to the grass, it being impossible for them other-wayes
to live in those cold Countries; the head of one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
these <em>Does</em> was sometime since nailed upon a sign-post in
<em>Charter-house-lane</em>, and these following verses written upon
a board underneath it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Like a</em> Bucks<em>-head I stand in open view,</em></div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><em>The living Beast that these fair horns did owe</em></div>

<p>And for their height since I came into <em>England</em> I have
read Dr. <em>Scroderns</em> his Chymical dispensatory translated
into <em>English</em> by Dr. <em>Rowland</em>, where he writes <em>that when
he lived in</em> Finland <em>under</em> Gustavus Horn, <em>he saw an</em> Elke
<em>that was killed and presented to</em> Gustavus <em>his Mother, seventeen
spans high</em>. Law you now Sirs of the Gibing crue,
if you have any skill in mensuration, tell me what difference
there is between Seventeen spans and twelve foot.
There are certain transcendentia in every Creature, which
are the indelible Characters of God, and which discover
God; There’s a prudential for you, as <em>John Rhodes</em> the
Fisherman used to say to his mate, <em>Kitt Lux</em>. But to go
on with the <em>Moose</em>; they are accounted a kind of Deer,
and have three <em>Calves</em> at a time, which they hide a mile
asunder too, as other Deer do, their skins make excellent
Coats for Martial men, their sinews which are as [p. 90.]
big as a mans finger are of perdurable toughness and
much used by the <em>Indians</em>, the bone that growes upon
their heart is an excellent Cordial, their bloud is as thick
as an <em>Asses</em> or <em>Bulls</em> who have the thickest bloud of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
others, a man the thinnest. To what age they live I know
not, certainly a long time in their proper climate. <em>Some
particular living Creatures cannot live in every particular
place or region, especially with the same joy and felicity as
it did where it was first bred, for the certain agreement of
nature that is between the place and the thing bred in that
place: As appeareth by</em> Elephants<em>, which being translated
and brought out of the Second or Third Climate, though
they may live, yet will they never ingender or bring forth
young.</em> So for plants, Birds, <em>&amp;c.</em> Of both these Creatures,
some few there have been brought into <em>England</em>,
but did not long continue. Sir <em>R. Baker</em> in his Chronicle
tells us of an <em>Elephant</em> in <em>Henry</em> the Thirds Raign, which
he saith was the first that was ever seen there, which as it
seems is an error, unless he restrain it to the <em>Norman’s</em>
time. For Mr. <em>Speed</em> writeth that <em>Claudius Drusius</em> Emperour
of <em>Rome</em> brought in the first in his Army; the
bones of which digg’d up since are taken for Gyants
bones. As for the <em>Moose</em> the first that was seen in <em>England</em>,
[p. 91.] was in King <em>Charles</em> the First Raign; thus
much for these magnals amongst the Creatures of God to
be wondered at, the next beast to be mentioned is</p>

<p>The <em>Maurouse</em>, which is somewhat like a <em>Moose</em>, but his
horns are but small, and himself about the size of a <em>Stag</em>,
these are the Deer that the flat-footed <em>Wolves</em> hunt after.</p>

<p>The <em>Maccarib</em> is a Creature not found that ever I
heard yet, but upon <em>Cape-Sable</em> near to the <em>French</em> plantations.</p>

<p>The <em>Bear</em> when he goes to mate is a terrible Creature,
they bring forth their Cubs in <em>March</em>, hunted with doggs
they take a Tree where they shoot them, when he is fat he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
is excellent Venison, which is in <em>Acorn</em> time, and in winter,
but then there is none dares to attempt to kill him
but the <em>Indian</em>. He makes his Denn amongst thick
Bushes, thrusting in here and there store of <em>Moss</em>, which
being covered with snow and melting in the day time
with heat of the Sun, in the night is frozen into a thick
coat of Ice; the mouth of his Den is very narrow, here
they lye single, never two in a Den all winter. The <em>Indian</em>
as soon as he finds them, creeps in upon all four,
seizes with his left hand upon the neck of the sleeping
<em>Bear</em>, drags him to the mouth of [p. 92.] the Den, where
with a club or small hatchet in his right hand he knocks
out his brains before he can open his eyes to see his enemy.
But sometimes they are too quick for the <em>Indians</em>,
as one amongst them called black Robin lighting upon a
male <em>Bear</em> had a piece of his buttock torn off before he
could fetch his blow: their grease is very soveraign. One
Mr. <em>Purchase</em> cured himself of the <em>Sciatica</em> with <em>Bears</em>-greefe,
keeping some of it continually in his groine. It is
good too for swell’d Cheeks upon cold, for Rupture of the
hands in winter, for limbs taken suddenly with <em>Sciatica</em>,
<em>Gout</em>, or other diseases that cannot stand upright nor go,
bed-rid; it must be well chaft in, and the same cloth laid
on still; it prevents the shedding of the hair occasioned by
the coldness of winters weather; and the yard of a <em>Bear</em>
which as a Doggs or Foxes is bonie, is good for to expell
Gravel out of the kidneys and bladder, as I was there
told by one Mr. <em>Abraham Philater</em> a <em>Jersey-man</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Beaver</em> or Pound-dog is an Amphibious Creature,
lives upon the land as well as in the water. I suppose
they feed upon fish, but am sure that the Bark of Trees is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
also their food; there is an old proverbial saying, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic me
jubes quotidie, ut fiber salicem</i>: you love me as the <em>Beaver</em>
doth the willow; [p. 93.] who eateth the Bark and killeth
the Tree. They will be tame, witness the <em>Beaver</em> that not
long since was kept at <em>Boston</em> in the <em>Massachusets-Bay</em>,
and would run up and down the streets, returning home
without a call. Their skins are highly valued, and their
stones are good for the palsie, trembling, and numbness of
the hands, boiling of them in Oyl of <em>Spike</em>, and anointing
the sinews in the neck. If you take of <em>Castorium</em> two
drams, of womans hair one dram, and with a little Rozen
of the <em>Pine</em>-Tree, make it up into pills as big as Filberts
and perfume a woman in a fit of the mother with one at
a time laid upon coals under her nostrils, it will recover
her out of her fit. The grease of a <em>Beaver</em> is good for the
Nerves, Convulsions, Epilepsies, Apoplexies <em>&amp;c.</em> The tail
as I have said in another Treatise, is very fat and of a
masculine vertue, as good as <em>Eringo’s</em> or <em>Satyrion</em>-Roots.</p>

<p>The <em>Otter</em> or River-<em>Dog</em> is Amphibious too, he hunteth
for his kind in the spring, and bringeth forth his whelps
as the <em>Beaver</em> doth, they are generally black, and very
numerous, they are hunted in <em>England</em> from <em>Shrovetide</em>
untill <em>Midsummer</em>, but in <em>New-England</em> they take them
when they can. The skin of an <em>Otter</em> is worth Ten Shillings,
[p. 94.] and the Gloves made thereof are the best
fortification for the hands against wet weather that can be
thought of, the furr is excellent for muffs, and is almost as
dear as <em>Beaver</em>, the grease of an <em>Otter</em> will make fish turn
up their bellies, and is of rare use for many things.</p>

<p>The <em>Hare</em>, I have no more to write of them than that
they kindle in hollow Trees. What else concerns him, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
any of the fore-mentioned Creatures you have in my <em>New-Englands</em>
rarities, to which I refer you.</p>

<p>The <em>Porcupine</em> likewise I have treated of, only this I
forgot to acquaint you with, that they lay Eggs, and are
good meat.</p>

<p>The last kind of Beasts are they that are begot by
equivocal generation, as <em>Mules</em> and several others, that
when the Beasts were brought by the Almighty Creator
to <em>Adam</em>, who gave them names, were not then in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rerum
natura</i>. Of these there are not many known in <em>New-England</em>.
I know but of one, and that is the <em>Indian</em> dog
begotten betwixt a <em>Wolf</em> and a <em>Fox</em>, or between a <em>Fox</em>
and a <em>Wolf</em>, which they made use of, taming of them, and
bringing of them up to hunt with, but since the <em>English</em>
came amongst them they have gotten store of our dogs,
which they bring up and keep in as much subjection as
they do their webbs.</p>

<p>[p. 95.] Of birds there are not many more than 120
kinds as our Naturalists have conjectured, but I think
they are deceived; they are divided into land-birds and
water-birds, the land-birds again into birds of prey, birds
for meat, singing-birds and others.</p>

<p>The <em>Pilhannaw</em> is the King of Birds of prey in <em>New-England</em>,
some take him to be a kind of <em>Eagle</em>, others for
the <em>Indian-Ruck</em> the biggest Bird that is, except the <em>Ostrich</em>.
One Mr. <em>Hilton</em> living at <em>Pascataway</em>, had the hap
to kill one of them: being by the Sea-side he perceived
a great shadow over his head, the Sun shining out clear,
calling up his eyes he saw a monstrous Bird soaring aloft
in the air, and of a sudden all the <em>Ducks</em> and <em>Geese</em>, (there
being then a great many) dived under water, nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
them appearing but their heads. Mr. <em>Hilton</em> having made
readie his piece, shot and brought her down to the ground,
how he disposed of her I know not, but had he taken her
alive &amp; sent her over into <em>England</em>, neither <em>Bartholomew</em>
nor <em>Sturbridge</em>-Fair could have produced such another
sight.</p>

<p><em>Hawkes</em> there are of several kinds, as <em>Goshawkes</em>, <em>Falcons</em>,
<em>Laniers</em>, <em>Sparrow-hawkes</em>, and a little black <em>hawke</em>
highly prized by the <em>Indians</em> who wear them on their [p. 96.]
heads, and is accounted of worth sufficient to ransome
a <em>Sagamour</em>: they are so strangely couragious and
hardie, that nothing flyeth in the Air that they will not
bind with. I have seen them tower so high, that they
have been so small that scarcely could they be taken by
the eye. <em>Hawkes</em> grease is very good for sore eyes.</p>

<p>The <em>Osprey</em> I have treated of. There is a small Ash-colour
Bird that is shaped like a <em>Hawke</em> with talons and
beak that falleth upon <em>Crowes</em>, mounting up into the Air
after them, and will beat them till they make them cry.</p>

<p>The <em>Vulture</em> or <em>Geire</em>, which is spoken of in <em>Levit.</em> 11. 14.
and called a <em>Gripe</em>, their skins are good to line doublets
with, and the bones of their head hung about the neck
helpeth the head-ach.</p>

<p>The <em>Gripe</em>; see <em>New Englands</em> rarities, and for the <em>Turkie</em>-buzzard.</p>

<p>The <em>Owl</em> the most flagging Bird that is, of which there
are three sorts, a great grey <em>Owl</em> with ears, a little grey
<em>Owl</em>, and a white <em>Owl</em>, which is no bigger than a <em>Thrush</em>.
<em>Plinie</em> writes that the brains of an <em>Owl</em> asswageth the pain
&amp; inflammation in the lap of the ear. And that Eggs of
an <em>Owl</em> put into the liquour that a tospot useth to be drunk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
with, will make him loath drunkenness [p. 97.] ever after.
But now peradventure some will say, what doth this man
mean to bring <em>Owls</em> to <em>Athens</em>? verily Sirs I presume to
say, had I brought over of the little white <em>Owls</em> they would
have been acceptable, they are good mousers, and pretty
Birds to look upon; the <em>Athenians</em>, no question are better
imployed than to take notice of my <em>Owls</em>, poor ragged
Birds they are and want those glittering golden feathers
that <em>Draiton’s Owl</em> is adorned with, yet they are somewhat
of that nature; if an <em>Athenian</em> chance in this season
of divertisement to cast an eye upon them I shall be glad,
but more glad if he vouchsafe to prune and correct their
feathers, which I confess are discomposed for want of Art;
plain Birds they are, and fit for none but plain men to
manage. Sirs do not mistake me, there’s no man living
honours an <em>Athenian</em> more than I do, especially where I
perceive great abilities concomiting with goodness of
nature: A good nature (saith Mr. <em>Perkins</em>) is the Character
of God, and God is the father of learning, knowledge,
and every good gift, and hath condescended to become
a School-master to us poor mortals, furnishing of us
with Philosophy, Historie, Divinity by his holy Scriptures,
which if we diligently learn and practise, we shall in [p.
98.] time be brought into his Heavenly Academy, where
we shall have fulness and perfection of knowledge eternally.
But there are a Generation of men and women in
this prophane age that despise Gods learning and his
Ushers to the <em>Athenians</em>, choosing to wallow in the pleasures
of sin for a season. I shall conclude this excursion,
with that which a Poet writ sometime since, and then
return to the trimming of my <em>Owl</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Raven</em> is here numerous and Crowes, but <em>Rooks</em>,
<em>Danes</em>, <em>Popinjaes</em>, <em>Megpies</em> there be none. It is observed
that the female of all Birds of prey and Ravin is ever
bigger than the male, more venturous, hardy, and watchful:
but such Birds as do not live by prey and Ravin, the
male is more large than the female. So much for Birds
of prey, the next are Birds for the dish, and the first of
these is,</p>

<p>[p. 99.] The <em>Turkie</em>, which is in <em>New-England</em> a very
large Bird, they breed twice or thrice in a year, if you
would preserve the young Chickens alive, you must give
them no water, for if they come to have their fill of water
they will drop away strangely, and you will never be able
to rear any of them: they are excellent meat, especially a
<em>Turkie-Capon</em> beyond that, for which Eight shillings was
given, their Eggs are very wholesome and restore decayed
nature exceedingly. But the <em>French</em> say they breed the
Leprosie; the Indesses make Coats of <em>Turkie</em>-feathers
woven for their Children.</p>

<p>The <em>Partridge</em> is larger than ours, white flesht, but
very dry, they are indeed a sort of <em>Partridges</em> called
<em>Grooses</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>The <em>Pidgeon</em>, of which there are millions of millions, I
have seen a flight of <em>Pidgeons</em> in the spring, and at <em>Michaelmas</em>
when they return back to the Southward for four
or five miles, that to my thinking had neither beginning
nor ending, length nor breadth, and so thick that I could
see no Sun, they joyn Nest to Nest, and Tree to Tree by
their Nests many miles together in <em>Pine</em>-Trees. But of
late they are much diminished, the <em>English</em> taking them
with Nets. I have bought at <em>Boston</em> a dozen of <em>Pidgeons</em>
ready pull’d and garbidgd for three pence, [p. 100.] Ring-<em>Doves</em>
they say are there too, but I could never see any.</p>

<p>The <em>Snow</em>-Bird is like a <em>Chaf-Finch</em>, go in flocks and
are good meat.</p>

<p>The singing Birds are <em>Thrushes</em> with red breasts, which
will be very fat and are good meat, so are the <em>Thressels</em>,
<em>Filladies</em> are small singing Birds, <em>Ninmurders</em> little yellow
Birds. <em>New-England</em> Nightingales painted with orient
colours, black, white, blew, yellow, green and scarlet, and
sing sweetly, <em>Wood-larks</em>, <em>Wrens</em>, <em>Swallows</em>, who will sit
upon Trees, and <em>Starlings</em> black as <em>Ravens</em> with scarlet
pinions; other sorts of Birds there are, as the <em>Troculus</em>,
<em>Wag-tail</em>, or <em>Dish-water</em>, which is here of a brown colour,
<em>Titmouse</em> two or three sorts, the Dunneck or hedge-<em>Sparrow</em>
who is starke naked in his winter nest. The golden or
yellow hammer, a Bird about the bigness of a <em>Thrush</em> that
is all over as red as bloud, Wood-<em>Peckers</em> of two or three
sorts, gloriously set out with variety of glittering colours.
The <em>Colibry</em>, <em>Viemalin</em>, or rising or waking Bird, an Emblem
of the Resurrection, and the wonder of little Birds.</p>

<p>The water-fowl are these that follow, <em>Hookers</em> or wild-<em>Swans</em>,
<em>Cranes</em>, <em>Geese</em> of three sorts, grey, white, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
brant <em>Goose</em>, the first and last are best meat, the white are
[p. 101.] lean and tough and live a long time; whereupon
the proverb, Older than a white <em>Goose</em>; of the skins of the
necks of grey <em>Geese</em> with their Bills the <em>Indians</em> makes
Mantles and Coverlets sowing them together and they
shew prettily. There be four sorts of <em>Ducks</em>, a black
<em>Duck</em>, a brown <em>Duck</em> like our wild <em>Ducks</em>, a grey <em>Duck</em>,
and a great black and white <em>Duck</em>, these frequent Rivers
and Ponds; but of <em>Ducks</em> there be many more sorts, as
<em>Hounds</em>, old <em>Wives</em>, <em>Murres</em>, <em>Doies</em>, <em>Shell-drakes</em>, <em>Shoulers</em>
or <em>Shoflers</em>, <em>Widgeons</em>, <em>Simps</em>, <em>Teal</em>, Blew wing’d, and

<em>Kings fishers</em>, which breed in the spring in holes in
the Sea-banks, being unapt to propagate in Summer, by
reason of the driness of their bodies, which becomes more
moist when their pores are closed by cold. Most of these
Fowls and Birds are eatable. There are little Birds that
frequent the Sea-shore in flocks called <em>Sanderlins</em>, [p.
102.] they are about the bigness of a <em>Sparrow</em>, and in the
fall of the leaf will be all fat; when I was first in the
Countrie the <em>English</em> cut them into small pieces to put
into their Puddings instead of suet, I have known twelve
score and above kill’d at two shots. I have not done yet,
we must not forget the <em>Cormorant</em>, <em>Shape</em> or <em>Sharke</em>;
though I cannot commend them to our curious palats, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
<em>Indians</em> will eat them when they are fley’d, they take them
prettily, they roost in the night upon some Rock that lyes
out in the Sea, thither the <em>Indian</em> goes in his Birch-<em>Canow</em>
when the Moon shines clear, and when he is come
almost to it, he lets his <em>Canow</em> drive on of it self, when he
is come under the Rock he shoves his Boat along till he
come just under the <em>Cormorants</em> watchman, the rest being
asleep, and so soundly do sleep that they will snore like so
many Piggs; the <em>Indian</em> thrusts up his hand of a sudden,
grasping the watchman so hard round about his neck that
he cannot cry out; as soon as he hath him in his <em>Canow</em>
he wrings off his head, and making his <em>Canow</em> fast, he
clambreth to the top of the Rock, where walking softly
he takes them up as he pleaseth, still wringing off their
heads; when he hath slain as many as his <em>Canow</em> can
carry, he gives a shout [p. 103.] which awakens the surviving
<em>Cormorants</em>, who are gone in an instant.</p>

<p>The next Creatures that you are to take notice of, are
they that live in the Element of water. <em>Pliny</em> reckons
them to be of 177 kinds, but certainly if it be true that
there is no Beast upon Earth, which hath not his like in
the Sea, and which (perhaps) is not in some part parallel’d
in the plants of the Earth; we may by a diligent search
find out many more: of the same opinion is the Poet, who
saith that it is</p>

<p>[p. 104.] Psalm 104.25, 26. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In ipso mari magno &amp; spatioso,
illic reptilia sunt atque innumera animantia parva
cum magnis. Illic navea ambulant; balæna quam formasti
ludendo in eo.</i></p>

<p>And as the females amongst Beasts and Birds of prey
for form and beautie surpass the males, so do they especially
amongst fishes; and those I intend to treat of, I
shall divide into salt-water fish, and fresh-water fish.</p>

<p>The Sea that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piscina mirabilis</i> affords us the greatest
number, of which I shall begin first with the Whale a regal
fish, as all fishes of extraordinary size are accounted, of
these there are (as I have said in another place) seven
kinds, the Ambergreese-<em>Whale</em> the chiefest. <em>Anno Dom.</em>
1668 the 17 of <em>July</em> there was one of them thrown up on
the shore between <em>Winter-harbour</em> and <em>Cape-porpus</em>, about
eight mile from the place where I lived, that was five and
fifty foot long. They are Creatures of a vast magnitude
and strength. The Royal Psalmist, in the 148 psalm, and
the 7 verse, <em>makes mention of them</em>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laudate Jehovam
terrestria; Cete</i> <em>(Dracones as some translate it) &amp;</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
abyssi.</i> <em>And Moses in his history of</em> Job, Job 41. 1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">An
extrahas balænam hamo</i>, &amp;c. [p. 105.] <em>Whereby the subtlety
of the Devil is shewed, as also, the greatness and brutishness
of the Devil by the Elephant, in the</em> 10 <em>verse of the
foregoing Chapter. In the book of</em> Jonas <em>prophecies we read
of a great fish</em>, Jonah 1. 17. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pararat autem Jehova piscem
magnum, qui obsorberet Jonam.</i> <em>But whether this
were a Whale or not is questioned by some. In the head
(saith Mr.</em> Parkinson <em>the Herbalist) of one only sort of
Whale-fish is found that which is called</em> sperma Cæti, <em>it
lyes in a hole therein, as it were a Well, taken out and
prest that the oyl may come out, the substance is that we use
for</em> sperma Cæti, <em>and hath little or no smell, the oyl smells
strong. See the rarities of</em> New-England.</p>

<p>The <em>Sea-hare</em> is as big as <em>Grampus</em> or <em>Herrin-hog</em>, and
as white as a sheet; There hath been of them in <em>Black-point</em>-Harbour,
&amp; some way up the river, but we could
never take any of them, several have shot sluggs at them,
but lost their labour.</p>

<p>The <em>Sturgeon</em> is a Regal fish too, I have seen of them
that have been sixteen foot in length: of their sounds they
make <em>Isinglass</em>, which melted in the mouth is excellent to
seal letters.</p>

<p><em>Sharkes</em> there are infinite store, who tear the Fishermens
nets to their great loss and hinderance; they are of
two sorts, one flat [p. 106.] headed, the other long-snouted,
the pretious stone in their heads (soveraign for the stone
in a man) so much coveted by the travelling Chirurgeon
is nought else but the brains of the flat-headed <em>Sharke</em>.
With these we may joyn the Dog-fish or Thorn-hound,
who hath two long sharp prickles on his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>The <em>Sea-horse</em> or <em>Morse</em> is a kind of monster-fish numerous
about the Isle of <em>Sables</em>, i. e. The sandy Isle. An
Amphibious Creature kill’d for their Teeth and Oyl,
never brings forth more than two at a birth; as also doth
the Soil and Manate or Cow-fish which is supposed to be
the Sea-monster spoken of by <em>Jeremy</em>, <em>Lament.</em> 4. 3.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Etiam phocæ præbent mammam, lactant catulos suos;</i> <em>So
the Latins render it</em>, phoca <em>a Sea-Calf or Soil</em>.</p>

<p>The small <em>Sword-fish</em> is very good meat, the <em>Sea-bat</em> or
<em>Sea-owl</em> a kind of flying fish.</p>

<p><em>Negroes</em> or <em>Sea-Devils</em> a very ugly fish, having a black
scale, there are three sorts of them, one a hideous fish,
another about two foot long; of these I have seen store in
<em>Black-point</em> Harbour in the water, but never attempted to
take any of them.</p>

<p><em>Squids</em> a soft fish somewhat like a cudgel, their horns
like a <em>Snails</em>, which sometimes are found to be of an incredible
length, [p. 107.] this fish is much used for bait to
catch a <em>Cod</em>, <em>Hacke</em>, <em>Polluck</em>, and the like Sea-fish.</p>

<p>The <em>Dolphin</em>, <em>Bonito</em>, or <em>Dozado</em>, the ashes of their teeth
mixed with honey, is good to asswage the pain of breeding
teeth in Children.</p>

<p>The <em>Sea-bream</em>, <em>Dorado</em>, or <em>Amber-fish</em>, they follow ships
as doth the <em>Dolphin</em>, and are good meat.</p>

<p>The <em>Mackarel</em>, of which there is choicefull plenty all
summer long, in the spring they are ordinarily 18 inches
long, afterwards there is none taken but what are smaller.</p>

<p>The <em>Liver-fish</em> like a <em>Whiting</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Herrin</em> which are numerous, they take of them all
summer long. In <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1670. they were driven into
<em>Black-point</em> Harbour by other great fish that prey upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
them so near the shore, that they threw themselves (it being
high water) upon dry land in such infinite numbers
that we might have gone up half way the leg amongst
them for near a quarter of a mile. We used to qualifie a
pickled <em>Herrin</em> by boiling of him in milk.</p>

<p>The <em>Alewife</em> is like a <em>herrin</em>, but has a bigger bellie
therefore called an <em>Alewife</em>, they come in the end of <em>April</em>
into fresh [p. 108.] Rivers and Ponds; there hath been
taken in two hours time by two men without any Weyre
at all, saving a few stones to stop the passage of the River,
above ten thousand. The <em>Italian</em> hath a proverb, that he
that hath seen one miracle will easily believe another; but
this relation far from a miracle will peranter meet, instead
of a belief with an Adulterate construction from those
that are somewhat akin to St. <em>Peters</em> mockers, such as
deny the last judgement. I have known in <em>England</em> 9
score and 16 <em>Pikes</em> and <em>Pickarel</em> taken with three Angles
between the hours of three and ten in the morning, in
the River <em>Owse</em> in the Isle of <em>Ely</em>, three quarters of a yard
long above half of them; they make red <em>Alewives</em> after
the same manner as they do <em>herrins</em> and are as good.</p>

<p>The <em>Basse</em> is a salt water fish too, but most an end taken
in Rivers where they spawn, there hath been 3000 <em>Basse</em>
taken at a set, one writes that the fat in the bone of a
<em>Basses</em> head is his brains which is a lye.</p>

<p>The <em>Salmon</em> likewise is a Sea-fish, but as the <em>Basse</em>
comes into Rivers to spawn, a <em>Salmon</em> the first year is a
<em>Salmon-smelt</em>; The second a <em>Mort</em>; The third a <em>Spraid</em>;
The fourth a <em>Soar</em>; The fifth a <em>Sorrel</em>; The sixth [p.
109.] a <em>forket tail</em>; and the seventh year a <em>Salmon</em>.
There are another sort of <em>Salmon</em> frequent in those
parts called white <em>Salmons</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p><em>Capeling</em> is a small fish like a smelt.</p>

<p>The <em>Turtle</em> or <em>Tortoise</em> is of two sorts Sea-<em>Turtles</em> and
land-<em>Turtles</em>: of Sea-<em>Turtles</em> there are five sorts, of land-<em>Turtles</em>
three sorts, one of which is a right land-<em>turtle</em> that
seldom or never goes into the water, the other two being
the River-<em>Turtle</em>, and the pond-<em>Turtle</em>: there are many of
these in the brooke <em>Chyson</em> in the <em>Holy land</em>. The ashes
of a Sea-<em>Turtle</em> mixt with oyl or <em>Bears</em>-grease causeth
hair to grow: the shell of a land-<em>Turtle</em> burnt and the
ashes dissolved in wine and oyl to an unguent healeth
chaps and sores of the feet: the flesh burnt and the ashes
mixt with wine and oyl healeth sore legs: the ashes of the
burnt shell and the whites of eggs compounded together
healeth chaps in womens nipples; and the head pulverized
with it prevents the falling of the hair, and will heal
the Hemorrhoids, first washing of them with white-wine,
and then strewing on the powder.</p>

<p><em>Lobster</em>, which some say is at first a <em>whelk</em>, I have seen
a <em>Lobster</em> that weighed twenty pound, they cast their shell-coats
in the spring, and so do <em>Crabs</em>; having underneath
a thin red skin which growes thicker and [p. 110.] hard in
short time. The <em>Indians</em> feed much upon this fish, some
they rost, and some they dry as they do <em>Lampres</em> and <em>Oysters</em>
which are delicate breakfast meat so ordered, the <em>Oysters</em>
are long shell’d, I have had of them nine inches long
from the joynt to the toe, containing an <em>Oyster</em> like those
the Latines called <em>Tridacuan</em> that were to be cut into
three pieces before they could get them into their mouths,
very fat and sweet.</p>

<p>The <em>Muscle</em> is of two sorts, Sea-<em>muscles</em> in which they
find Pearl and river-<em>muscles</em>. Sea-<em>muscles</em> dryed and pulverized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
and laid upon the sores of the <em>Piles</em> and <em>hemorrhoids</em>
with oyl will perfectly cure them.</p>

<p>The <em>Whore</em> is a shell-fish, the shells are called whores-eggs,
being fine round white shells, in shape like a <em>Mexico</em>
pompion, but no bigger than a good large Hens-egg;
they are wrought down the sides with little knobs and
holes very prettily, but are but thin and brittle.</p>

<p>The <em>Perriwig</em> is a shell-fish that lyeth in the Sands flat
and round as a shovel-board piece and very little thicker;
these at a little hole in the middle of the shell thrust out a
cap of hair, but upon the least motion of any danger it
drawes it in again.</p>

<p><em>Trouts</em> there be good store in every brook, ordinarily
two and twenty inches [p. 111.] long, their grease is good
for the <em>Piles</em> and <em>clifts</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Eal</em> is of two sorts, salt-water <em>Eals</em> and fresh-water
<em>Eals</em>; these again are distinguished into yellow bellied
<em>Eals</em> and silver bellied <em>Eals</em>; I never eat better <em>Eals</em> in
no part of the world that I have been in, than are here.
They that have no mind or leasure to take them, may buy
of an <em>Indian</em> half a dozen silver bellied <em>Eals</em> as big as
those we usually give 8 pence or 12 pence a piece for at
<em>London</em>, for three pence or a groat. There is several wayes
of cooking them, some love them roasted, others baked,
and many will have them fryed; but they please my palate
best when they are boiled, a common way it is to boil
them in half water, half wine with the bottom of a manchet,
a fagot of Parsley, and a little winter savory, when
they are boiled they take them out and break the bread
in the broth, and put to it three or four spoonfuls of yest,
and a piece of sweet butter, this they pour to their <em>Eals</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
laid upon sippets and so serve it up. I fancie my way
better which is this, after the <em>Eals</em> are fley’d and washt I
fill their bellies with Nutmeg grated and Cloves a little
bruised, and sow them up with a needle and thred, then I
stick a Clove here and there in their sides about an inch
asunder, [p. 112.] making holes for them with a bodkin,
this done I wind them up in a wreath and put them into
a kettle with half water and half white wine-vinegar, so
much as will rise four fingers above the <em>Eals</em>, in midst
of the <em>Eals</em> I put the bottom of a penny white loaf, and a
fagot of these herbs following, Parsley one handful, a little
sweet Marjoram, Peniroyal and Savory, a branch of Rosemary,
bind them up with a thred, and when they are
boiled enough take out the <em>Eals</em> and pull out the threds
that their bellies were sowed up with, turn out the Nutmeg
and Cloves, put the <em>Eals</em> in a dish with butter and
vinegar upon a chafing-dish with coals to keep warm,
then put into the broth three or four spoonfuls of good
Ale-yeast with the juice of half a Lemmon; but before
you put in your yeast beat it in a porringer with some of
the broth, then break the crust of bread very small and
mingle it well together with the broth, pour it into a deep
dish and garnish it with the other half of the Lemmon,
and so serve them up to the Table in two dishes.</p>

<p>The <em>Frost fish</em> is little bigger than a <em>Gudgeon</em> and are
taken in fresh brooks; when the waters are frozen they
make a hole in the Ice about half a yard or yard wide, to
which the fish repair in great numbers, where with [p. 113.]
small nets bound to a hoop about the bigness of a firkin-hoop
with a staff fastned to it they lade them out of the
hole. I have not done with the fish yet, being willing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
let you know all of them that are to be seen and catch’d
in the Sea and fresh waters in <em>New-England</em>, and because
I will not tire your patience overmuch, having no occasion
to enlarge my discourse, I shall only name them and
so conclude.</p>

<p>The fish are swum by, and the Serpents are creeping
on, terrible creatures, carrying stings in their tails. That
will smart worse than a <em>Satyrs</em> whip, though it were as
big as Mr. <em>Shepperds</em> the mad Gentleman at <em>Milton-Mowbrayes
Constantinus Lasculus</em>.</p>

<p>The chief or Captain of these is the Rattle-snake described
already in my Journal, in some places of the Countrey
there are none as at <em>Plimouth</em>, <em>New-town</em>, <em>Nahant</em>
and some other places, they will live on one side of the
River, and but swimming over and coming into the woods
dye immediately.</p>

<p>The fat of a Rattle-snake is very Soveraign for frozen
limbs, bruises, lameness by falls, Aches, Sprains. The
heart of a Rattle-snake dried and pulverized and drunk
with wine or beer is an approved remedy against the biting
and venome of a Rattle-snake. Some body will give
me thanks for [p. 115.] discovering these secrets and the
rest; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non omnibus omnia conveniant</i>.</p>

<p>The <em>Snake</em> of which there are infinite numbers of various
colours, some black, others painted with red, yellow
and white, some again of a grass-green colour powdered
all over as it were with silver dust or <em>Muscovie</em>-glass. But
there is one sort that exceeds all the rest, and that is the
Checkquered snake, having as many colours within the
checkquers shaddowing one another, as there are in a
Rainbow. There are two sorts of snakes, the land-snake
and the water-snake; the water-snake will be as big about
the belly as the Calf of a mans leg; I never heard of any
mischief that snakes did, they kill them sometimes for
their skins and bones to make hatbands off, their skins
likewise worn as a Garter is an excellent remedie against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the cramp. I have found of the skins that they cast in
woods in some quantity, they cast not their very skins, but
only the superfluous thin skin that is upon the very skin,
for the very skin is basted to the flesh, so Lobsters and
Crabs.</p>

<p>The Earth-worm, these are very rare and as small as a
horse hair, but there is a Bug that lyes in the earth and
eateth the seed, that is somewhat like a Maggot of a white
colour with a red head, and is about [p. 116.] the bigness
of ones finger and an inch or an inch and half long.
There is also a dark dunnish Worm or Bug of the bigness
of an Oaten-straw, and an inch long, that in the spring
lye at the Root of Corn and Garden plants all day, and
in the night creep out and devour them; these in some
years destroy abundance of <em>Indian</em> Corn and Garden
plants, and they have but one way to be rid of them,
which the <em>English</em> have learnt of the <em>Indians</em>; And because
it is somewhat strange, I shall tell you how it is,
they go out into a field or garden with a Birchen-dish,
and spudling the earth about the roots, for they lye not
deep, they gather their dish full which may contain about
a quart or three pints, then they carrie the dish to the
Sea-side when it is ebbing-water and set it a swimming,
the water carrieth the dish into the Sea and within a day
or two if you go into your field you may look your eyes
out sooner than find any of them.</p>

<p><em>Sow-bugs</em> or <em>Millipedes</em> there be good store, but none
of that sort that are blew and turn round as a pea when
they are touched; neither are there any <em>Beetles</em> nor <em>Maple-bugs</em>,
but a stinking black and red <em>Bug</em> called a <em>Cacarooch</em>
or <em>Cockroach</em>, and a little black <em>Bug</em> like a <em>Lady-cow</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
that breeds in skins and furrs and will eat them to
their [p. 117.] utter spoil. Likewise there be infinite
numbers of <em>Tikes</em> hanging upon the bushes in summer
time that will cleave to a mans garments and creep into
his Breeches eating themselves in a short time into the
very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockins of those
that have gone through the woods covered with them.
Besides these there is a <em>Bug</em>, but whether it be a Native
to the Countrie or a stranger I cannot say: Some are of
opinion that they are brought in by the Merchant with
Spanish goods, they infest our beds most, all day they hide
themselves, but when night comes they will creep to the
sleeping wretch and bite him worse than a flea, which
raiseth a swelling knub that will itch intolerably, if you
scratch it waxeth bigger and growes to a scab; and if you
chance to break one of the <em>Bugs</em> it will stink odiously:
they call them <em>Chinches</em> or <em>Wood-lice</em>, they are fat, red
and in shape like a <em>Tike</em> and no bigger. There are also
Palmer-worms which is a kind of Catterpiller, these some
years will devour the leaves of Trees leaving them as
naked almost as in winter, they do much harm in the
<em>English</em> Orchards. Of <em>Snails</em> there are but few, and those
very little ones, they lye at the Roots of long grass in
moist places, and are no where else to be found. [p. 118.]
Spiders and Spinners there be many, the last very big
and of several colours.</p>

<p>The Pismire or Ant must not be forgotten, accounted
the least Creature, and by <em>Salomon</em> commended for its
wisdom, Prov. 30. 24, 25. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quatuor ista parva sunt humilia,

There are two sorts, red Ants and black Ants, both of
them are many times found winged; not long since they
were poured upon the Sands out of the clouds in a storm
betwixt <em>Black-point</em> and <em>Saco</em>, where the passenger might
have walkt up to the Ankles in them.</p>

<p>The Grashopper is innumerable and bigger by much
than ours in <em>England</em>, having Tinsel-wings, with help
whereof they will flye and skip a great way. Next to
these in number are your Crickets, a man can walk no
where in the summer but he shall tread upon them; The
<em>Italian</em> who hath them cryed up and down the streets
(<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Grille che cantelo</i>) and buyeth them to put into his Gardens,
if he were in <em>New-England</em> would gladly be rid of
them, they make such a dinn in an Evening. I could
never discover the Organ of their voice, they have a little
clift in their Crown which opens, and at the same instant
they shake their wings.</p>

<p>[p. 119.] The Eft or Swift in <em>New-England</em> is a most
beautiful Creature to look upon, being larger than ours,
and painted with glorious colours; but I lik’d him never
the better for it.</p>

<p>Frogs too there are in ponds and upon dry land, they
chirp like Birds in the spring, and latter end of summer
croak like Toads. It is admirable to consider the generating
of these Creatures, first they lay their gelly on the
water in ponds and still waters, which comes in time to be
full of black spots as broad as the head of a Ten-penny
nail, and round, these separate themselves from the gleir,
and after a while thrust out a tail, then their head comes
forth, after their head springs out their fore-legs, and then
their hinder-legs, then their tail drops off, and growes to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
have a head and four legs too, the first proves a frog, the
latter a water nuet. The Herbalist useth to say by way
of admiration, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quælibet herba deum &amp;c.</i> So God is seen
in the production of these small Creatures which are a
part of the Creation; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laudate Jehovam cælites, laudate
eum in excelsis</i>, &amp;c. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laudent nomen Jehovæ quæ ipso præcipiente
illico creata sunt</i> &amp;c. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipsæ bestiæ &amp; omnes jumenta,
reptilia &amp; aves alatæ</i>, Psal. 148.</p>

<p>The Toad is of two sorts, one that is [p. 120.] speckled
with white, and another of a dark earthy colour; there
is of them that will climb up into Trees and sit croaking
there; but whether it be of a third sort, or one of the
other, or both, I am not able to affirm; but this I can testifie
that there be Toads of the dark coloured kind that
are as big as a groat loaf. Which report will not swell
into the belief of my sceptique Sirs; nor that there is a
Hell, being like <em>Salomon’s</em> fool, Prov. 26. 22. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed si contunderes
stultum in mortario cum mola pistillo, non recederet
ab eo stultitia ejus.</i></p>

<p>Now before I proceed any further, I must (to prevent
misconstructions) tell you that these following Creatures,
though they be not properly accounted Serpents, yet they
are venomous and pestilent Creatures. As, first the Rat,
but he hath been brought in since the <em>English</em> came
thither, but the Mouse is a Native, of which there are several
kinds not material to be described; the Bat or flitter
mouse is bigger abundance than any in <em>England</em> and
swarm, which brings me to the insects or cut-wasted
Creatures again, as first the honey-Bee, which are carried
over by the <em>English</em> and thrive there exceedingly, in time
they may be produced from Bullocks when the wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Beasts are destroyed. But the wasp is [p. 121.] common,
and they have a sort of wild humble-Bee that breed in
little holes in the earth. Near upon twenty years since
there lived an old planter at <em>Black-point</em>, who on a Sun-shine
day about one of the clock lying upon a green
bank not far from his house, charged his Son, a lad of 12
years of age to awaken him when he had slept two hours,
the old man falls asleep and lying upon his back gaped
with his mouth wide enough for a Hawke to shit into it;
after a little while the lad sitting by spied a humble-Bee
creeping out of his Fathers mouth, which taking wing
flew quite out of sight, the hour as the lad ghest being
come to awaken his Father he jogg’d him and called
aloud Father, Father, it is two a clock, but all would not
rouse him, at last he sees the humble-Bee returning, who
lighted upon the sleepers lip and walked down as the lad
conceived into his belly, and presently he awaked.</p>

<p>The Countrey is strangely incommodated with flyes,
which the <em>English</em> call Musketaes, they are like our gnats,
they will sting so fiercely in summer as to make the faces
of the <em>English</em> swell’d and scabby, as if the small pox for
the first year. Likewise there is a small black fly no bigger
than a flea, so numerous up in the Countrey, [p. 122.]
that a man cannot draw his breath, but he will suck of
them in: they continue about Thirty dayes say some,
but I say three moneths, and are not only a pesterment
but a plague to the Countrey. There is another sort of
fly called a Gurnipper that are like our horse-flyes, and
will bite desperately, making the bloud to spurt out in
great quantity; these trouble our <em>English</em> Cattle very
much, raising swellings as big as an egg in their hides.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
The Butterfly is of several sorts and larger than ours; So
are their Dragon-flyes. Glow-worms have here wings,
there are multitudes of them insomuch that in the dark
evening when I first went into the Countrey I thought
the whole Heavens had been on fire, seeing so many
sparkles flying in the air: about <em>Mount-Carmel</em>, and the
valley of <em>Acree</em> in the <em>Holy-land</em> there be abundance of
them.</p>

<p>These are taken for <em>Cantharides</em>. <em>Cantharides</em> are
green flyes by day, in the night they pass about like a flying
Glow-worm with fire in their tails.</p>

<p>I have finished now my relation of plants, <em>&amp;c.</em> I have
taken some pains in recollecting of them to memory, and
setting of them down for their benefit from whom I may
expect thanks; but I believe my [p. 123.] reward will
be according to <em>Ben Johnsons</em> proverbs, Whistle to a Jade
and he will pay you with a fart, Claw a churl by the britch
and he will shit in your fist.</p>

<p>The people that inhabited this Countrey are judged to
be of the <em>Tartars</em> called <em>Samonids</em> that border upon <em>Moscovia</em>,
and are divided into Tribes; those to the East and
North-east are called <em>Churchers</em> and <em>Tarentines</em>, and <em>Monhegans</em>.
To the South are the <em>Pequets</em> and <em>Narragansets</em>.
Westward <em>Connecticuts</em> and <em>Mowhacks</em>. To the Northward
<em>Aberginians</em> which consist of <em>Mattachusets</em>, <em>Wippanaps</em>
and <em>Tarrentines</em>. The <em>Pocanokets</em> live to the West-ward
of <em>Plimouth</em>. Not long before the <em>English</em> came into
the Countrey, happened a great mortality amongst them,
especially where the <em>English</em> afterwards planted, the East
and Northern parts were sore smitten with the Contagion;
first by the plague, afterwards when the <em>English</em> came by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
the small pox, the three Kingdoms or <em>Sagamorships</em> of
the <em>Mattachusets</em> were very populous, having under them
seven Dukedoms or petti-<em>Sagamorships</em>, but by the plague
were brought from 30000 to 300. There are not many
now to the Eastward, the <em>Pequots</em> were destroyed by the
<em>English</em>: the <em>Mowhacks</em> are about five hundred: Their
speech a dialect of the <em>Tartars</em>, [p. 124.] (as also is the
<em>Turkish</em> tongue). There is difference between Tongues
and Languages, the division of speech at <em>Babel</em> is most
properly called Languages, the rest Tongues.</p>

<p>As for their persons they are tall and handsome timber’d
people, out-wristed, pale and lean <em>Tartarian</em> visag’d,
black eyed which is accounted the strongest for sight, and
generally black hair’d, both smooth and curl’d wearing of
it long. No beards, or very rarely, their Teeth are very
white, short and even, they account them the most necessary
and best parts of man; And as the <em>Austreans</em> are
known by their great lips, the <em>Bavarians</em> by their pokes
under their chins, the <em>Jews</em> by their goggle eyes, so the
<em>Indians</em> by their flat noses, yet are they not so much deprest
as they are to the Southward.</p>

<p>The <em>Indesses</em> that are young, are some of them very
comely, having good features, their faces plump and
round, and generally plump of their Bodies, as are the
men likewise, and as soft and smooth as a mole-skin, of
reasonable good complexions, but that they dye themselves
tawnie, many prettie Brownetto’s and spider finger’d
Lasses may be seen amongst them. The <em>Vetula’s</em> or old
women are lean and uglie, all of them are of a modest
demeanor, considering their [p. 125.] Savage breeding;
and indeed do shame our <em>English</em> rusticks whose rudeness
in many things exceedeth theirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>Of disposition very inconstant, crafty, timorous, quick
of apprehension, and very ingenious, soon angry, and so
malicious that they seldom forget an injury, and barbarously
cruel, witness their direful revenges upon one another.
Prone to injurious violence and slaughter, by reason
of their bloud dryed up with overmuch fire, very
lecherous proceeding from choller adust and melancholy,
a salt and sharp humour; very fingurative or theevish, and
bold importunate beggars, both Men and Women guilty
of Misoxenie or hatred to strangers, a quality appropriated
to the old Brittains, all of them Cannibals, eaters of
humane flesh. And so were formerly the Heathen-<em>Irish</em>,
who used to feed upon the Buttocks of Boyes and Womens
Paps; it seems it is natural to Savage people so to
do. I have read in Relations of the <em>Indians</em> amongst the
<em>Spaniards</em> that they would not eat a <em>Spaniard</em> till they
had kept him two or three dayes to wax tender, because
their flesh was hard. At <em>Martins</em> vinyard, an Island that
lyes South to <em>Plimouth</em> in the way to <em>Virginia</em>, certain
<em>Indians</em> (whilst I was in the Countrey) seised upon a Boat
that put into [p. 126.] a By-<em>Cove</em>, kill’d the men and eat
them up in a short time before they were discovered.</p>

<p>Their houses which they call <em>Wigwams</em>, are built with
Poles pitcht into the ground of a round form for most
part, sometimes square, they bind down the tops of their
poles, leaving a hole for smoak to go out at, the rest they
cover with the bark of Trees, and line the inside of their
<em>Wigwams</em> with mats made of Rushes painted with several
colours, one good post they set up in the middle that
reaches to the hole in the top, with a staff across before it
at a convenient height, they knock in a pin on which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
hang their Kettle, beneath that they set up a broad stone
for a back which keepeth the post from burning; round
by the walls they spread their mats and skins where the
men sleep whilst their women dress their victuals, they
have commonly two doors, one opening to the South,
the other to the North, and according as the wind sits,
they close up one door with bark and hang a <em>Dears</em> skin
or the like before the other. Towns they have none, being
alwayes removing from one place to another for conveniency
of food, sometimes to those places where one sort
of fish is most plentiful, other whiles where others are. I
have seen half [p. 127.] a hundred of their <em>Wigwams</em> together
in a piece of ground and they shew prettily, within
a day or two, or a week they have been all dispersed. They
live for the most part by the Sea-side, especially in the
spring and summer quarters, in winter they are gone up
into the Countrie to hunt <em>Deer</em> and <em>Beaver</em>, the younger
webbs going with them. Tame Cattle they have none,
excepting Lice, and Doggs of a wild breed that they
bring up to hunt with.</p>

<p>Wives they have two or three, according to the ability
of their bodies and strength of their concupiscence, who
have the easiest labours of any women in the world; they
will go out when their time is come alone, carrying a
board with them two foot long, and a foot and half broad,
bor’d full of holes on each side, having a foot beneath like
a Jack that we pull Boots off with, on the top of the board
a broad strap of leather which they put over their fore-head,
the board hanging at their back; when they are
come to a Bush or a Tree that they fancy they lay them
down and are delivered in a trice, not so much as groaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
for it, they wrap the child up in a young <em>Beaver</em>-skin with
his heels close to his britch, leaving a little hole if it be a
Boy for his Cock to peep out at; and lace him down to
the [p. 128.] board upon his back, his knees resting upon
the foot beneath, then putting the strap of leather upon
their fore-head with the infant hanging at their back
home they trudge; What other ceremonies they use
more than dying of them with a liquor of boiled <em>Hemlock</em>-Bark,
and their throwing of them into the water if they
suspect the Child to be gotten by any other Nation, to see
if he will swim, if he swim they acknowledge him for their
own, their names they give them when they are men
grown, and covet much to be called after our <em>English</em>
manner, <em>Robin</em>, <em>Harry</em>, <em>Phillip</em> and the like, very indulgent
they are to their Children, and their children sometimes
to their Parents, but if they live so long that they
become a burden to them, they will either starve them or
bury them alive, as it was supposed an <em>Indian</em> did his
Mother at <em>Casco</em> in 1669.</p>

<p>Their Apparel before the <em>English</em> came amongst them,
was the skins of wild Beasts with the hair on, Buskins of
<em>Deers</em>-skin or <em>Moose</em> drest and drawn with lines into several
works, the lines being coloured with yellow, blew or
red, Pumps too they have, made of tough skins without
soles. In the winter when the snow will bear them, they
fasten to their feet their snow shooes which are made like
a large Racket we play at [p. 129.] <em>Tennis</em> with, lacing
them with <em>Deers</em>-guts and the like, under their belly they
wear a square piece of leather and the like upon their
posteriors, both fastened to a string tyed about them to
hide their secrets; on their heads they ware nothing: But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
since they have had to do with the English they purchase
of them a sort of Cloth called trading cloth of which they
make Mantles, Coats with short sleeves, and caps for their
heads which the women use, but the men continue their
old fashion going bare-headed, excepting some old men
amongst them. They are very proud as appeareth by
their setting themselves out with white and blew Beads of
their own making, and painting of their faces with the
above mentioned colours, they weave sometimes curious
Coats with <em>Turkie</em> feathers for their Children.</p>

<p>Their Diet is Fish and Fowl, Bear, Wild-cat, Rattoon
and Deer; dry’d Oysters, <em>Lobsters</em> rosted or dryed in the
smoak, <em>Lampres</em> and dry’d <em>Moose</em>-tongues, which they
esteem a dish for a <em>Sagamor</em>; hard eggs boiled and made
small and dryed to thicken their broth with, salt they have
not the use of, nor bread, their <em>Indian</em> Corn and Kidney
beans they boil, and sometimes eat their Corn parcht or
roasted in the ear against the fire; they feed likewise upon
earth-nuts, [p. 130.] or ground-nuts, roots of water-Lillies,
Ches-nuts, and divers sorts of Berries. They beat their
Corn to powder and put it up into bags, which they make
use of when stormie weather or the like will not suffer
them to look out for their food. <em>Pompions</em> and water-<em>Mellons</em>
too they have good store; they have prodigious
stomachs, devouring a cruel deal, meer <em>voragoes</em>, never giving
over eating as long as they have it, between meals
spending their time in sleep till the next kettlefull is
boiled, when all is gone they satisfie themselves with a
small quantity of the meal, making it serve as the frugal
bit amongst the old <em>Britains</em>, which taken to the mountenance
of a Bean would satisfie both thirst and hunger. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
they have none of this, as sometimes it falleth out (being
a very careless people not providing against the storms of
want and tempest of necessity) they make use of Sir <em>Francis
Drake’s</em> remedy for hunger, go to sleep.</p>

<p>They live long, even to an hundred years of age, if
they be not cut off by their Children, war, and the plague,
which together with the small pox hath taken away abundance
of them. <em>Pliny</em> reckons up but 300 Diseases in
and about man, latter writers Six thousand, 236 belonging
to the eyes. There are not so many Diseases raigning
[p. 131.] amongst them as our <em>Europeans</em>. The great
pox is proper to them, by reason (as some do deem) that
they are <em>Man-eaters</em>, which disease was brought amongst
our <em>Europeans</em> first by the <em>Spaniards</em> that went with
<em>Christopher Columbus</em> who brought it to <em>Naples</em> with their
<em>Indian</em>-women, with whom the <em>Italians</em> and <em>French</em> conversed
<em>Anno Dom.</em> 1493. <em>Paracelsus</em> saith it happened in
the year 1478 and 1480. But all agree that it was not
known in <em>Europe</em> before <em>Columbus</em> his voyage to <em>America</em>.
It hath continued amongst us above two hundred
and three score years. There are Diseases that are proper
to certain climates, as the Leprosie to <em>Ægypt</em>, swelling of
the Throat or <em>Mentegra</em> to <em>Asia</em>, the sweating sickness to
the Inhabitants of the North; to the <em>Portugals</em> the
Phthisick, to <em>Savoy</em> the mumps; So to the <em>West-Indies</em> the
Pox, but this doth not exclude other Diseases. In <em>New-England</em>
the <em>Indians</em> are afflicted with pestilent Feavers,
Plague, Black-pox, Consumption of the Lungs, Falling-sickness,
Kings-evil, and a Disease called by the <em>Spaniard</em>
the Plague in the back, with us <em>Empyema</em>, their Physicians
are the <em>Powaws</em> or <em>Indian</em> Priests who cure sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
by charms and medicine, but in a general infection
they seldom come amongst them, [p. 132.] therefore they
use their own remedies, which is sweating, <em>&amp;c.</em> Their
manner is when they have plague or small pox amongst
them to cover their <em>Wigwams</em> with Bark so close that no
Air can enter in, lining them (as I said before) within, and
making a great fire they remain there in a stewing heat
till they are in a top sweat, and then run out into the Sea
or River, and presently after they are come into their
Hutts again they either recover or give up the Ghost;
they dye patiently both men and women, not knowing of
a Hell to scare them, nor a Conscience to terrifie them.
In times of general Mortality they omit the Ceremonies
of burying, exposing their dead Carkases to the Beasts of
prey. But at other times they dig a Pit and set the diseased
therein upon his breech upright, and throwing in
the earth, cover it with the sods and bind them down with
sticks, driving in two stakes at each end; their mournings
are somewhat like the howlings of the <em>Irish</em>, seldom at the
grave but in the <em>Wigwam</em> where the party dyed, blaming
the Devil for his hard heartedness, and concluding with
rude prayers to him to afflict them no further.</p>

<p>They acknowledge a God who they call <em>Squantam</em>, but
worship him they do not, [p. 133.] because (they say) he
will do them no harm. But <em>Abbamocho</em> or <em>Cheepie</em> many
times smites them with incurable Diseases, scares them
with his Apparitions and pannick Terrours, by reason
whereof they live in a wretched consternation worshipping
the Devil for fear. One black <em>Robin</em> an <em>Indian</em> sitting
down in the Corn field belonging to the house where
I resided, ran out of his <em>Wigwam</em> frighted with the apparition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
of two infernal spirits in the shape of <em>Mohawkes</em>.
Another time two <em>Indians</em> and an <em>Indess</em>, came running
into our house crying out they should all dye, <em>Cheepie</em> was
gone over the field gliding in the Air with a long rope
hanging from one of his legs: we askt them what he was
like, they said all wone <em>Englishman</em>, clothed with hat and
coat, shooes and stockings, <em>&amp;c.</em> They have a remarkable
observation of a flame that appears before the death of an
<em>Indian</em> or <em>English</em> upon their <em>Wigwams</em> in the dead of the
night: The first time that I did see it, I was call’d out by
some of them about twelve of the clock, it being a very
dark night, I perceived it plainly mounting into the Air
over our Church, which was built upon a plain little more
than half a quarter of a mile from our dwelling house, on
the Northside of the Church: look on [p. 134.] what side
of a house it appears, from that Coast respectively you
shall hear of a Coarse within two or three days.</p>

<p>They worship the Devil (as I said) their Priests are called
<em>Powaws</em> and are little better than Witches, for they have
familiar conference with him, who makes them invulnerable,
that is shot-free and stick-free. Craftie Rogues, abusing
the rest at their pleasure, having power over them by
reason of their Diabolical Art in curing of Diseases, which
is performed with rude Ceremonies; they place the sick
upon the ground sitting, and dance in an Antick manner
round about him, beating their naked breasts with a strong
hand, and making hideous faces, sometimes calling upon
the Devil for his help, mingling their prayers with horrid
and barbarous charms; if the sick recover they send rich
gifts, their Bowes and Arrowes, <em>Wompompers</em>, <em>Mohacks</em>,
<em>Beaver skins</em>, or other rich Furs to the Eastward, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
there is a vast Rock not far from the shore, having a hole
in it of an unsearchable profundity, into which they throw
them.</p>

<p>Their Theologie is not much, but questionless they
acknowledge a God and a Devil, and some small light
they have of the Souls immortality; for ask them [p. 135.]
whither they go when they dye, they will tell you
pointing with their finger to Heaven beyond the white
mountains, and do hint at <em>Noah’s</em> Floud, as may be conceived
by a story they have received from Father to Son,
time out of mind, that a great while agon their Countrey
was drowned, and all the People and other Creatures in
it, only one <em>Powaw</em> and his <em>Webb</em> foreseeing the Floud,
fled to the white mountains carrying a hare along with
them and so escaped; after a while the <em>Powaw</em> sent the
<em>Hare</em> away, who not returning emboldned thereby they
descended, and lived many years after, and had many
Children, from whom the Countrie was filled again with
<em>Indians.</em> Some of them tell another story of the <em>Beaver</em>,
saying that he was their Father.</p>

<p>Their learning is very little or none, Poets they are as
may be ghessed by their formal speeches, sometimes an
hour long, the last word of a line riming with the last
word of the following line, and the whole doth <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Constare
ex pedibus</i>. Musical too they be, having many pretty odd
barbarous tunes which they make use of vocally at marriages
and feastings; but Instruments they had none before
the <em>English</em> came amongst them, since they have
imitated them and will make out Kitts and string them
as neatly, [p. 136.] and as Artificially as the best Fiddle-maker
amongst us; and will play our plain lessons very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
exactly: the only Fidler that was in the Province of <em>Meyn</em>,
when I was there, was an <em>Indian</em> called <em>Scozway</em>, whom
the Fishermen and planters when they had a mind to be
merry made use of.</p>

<p>Arithmetick they skill not, reckoning to ten upon their
fingers, and if more doubling of it by holding their fingers
up, their age they reckon by Moons, and their actions
by sleeps, as, if they go a journie, or are to do any
other business they will say, three sleeps me walk, or two
or three sleeps me do such a thing, that is in two or three
days. Astronomie too they have no knowledge of, seldom
or never taking observation of the Stars, Eclipses, or Comets
that I could perceive; but they will Prognosticate
shrewdly what weather will fall out. They are generally
excellent <em>Zenagogues</em> or guides through their Countrie.</p>

<p>Their exercises are hunting and fishing, in both they
will take abundance of pains. When the snow will bear
them, the young and lustie <em>Indians</em>, (leaving their papouses
and old people at home) go forth to hunt <em>Moose</em>,
<em>Deere</em>, <em>Bear</em> and <em>Beaver</em>, Thirty or forty miles up into the
Countrey; when they light upon a <em>Moose</em> they run him
down, [p. 137.] which is sometimes in half a day, sometimes
a whole day, but never give him over till they have
tyred him, the snow being usually four foot deep, and the
Beast very heavie he sinks every step, and as he runs sometimes
bears down Arms of Trees that hang in his way,
with his horns, as big as a mans thigh; other whiles, if
any of their dogs (which are but small) come near, yerking
out his heels (for he strikes like a horse) if a small
Tree be in the way he breaks it quite asunder with one
stroak, at last they get up to him on each side and transpierce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
him with their Lances, which formerly were no
other but a staff of a yard and half pointed with a Fishes
bone made sharp at the end, but since they put on pieces
of sword-blades which they purchase of the <em>French</em>, and
having a strap of leather fastned to the but end of the
staff which they bring down to the midst of it, they dart
it into his sides, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hæret latere lethalis arundo</i>, the poor
Creature groans, and walks on heavily, for a space, then
sinks and falls down like a ruined building, making the
Earth to quake; then presently in come the Victors, who
having cut the throat of the slain take off his skin, their
young webbs by this time are walking towards them with
heavie bags and kettles at their [p. 138.] backs, who laying
down their burdens fall to work upon the Carkass,
take out the heart, and from that the bone, cut off the left
foot behind, draw out the sinews, and cut out his tongue
<em>&amp;c.</em> and as much of the Venison as will serve to satiate
the hungry mawes of the Company; mean while the men
pitch upon a place near some spring, and with their snow
shoos shovel the snow away to the bare Earth in a circle,
making round about a wall of snow; in the midst they
make their <em>Vulcan</em> or fire near to a great Tree, upon the
snags whereof they hang their kettles fil’d with the Venison;
whilst that boils, the men after they have refresht
themselves with a pipe of Tobacco dispose themselves to
sleep. The women tend the Cookerie, some of them scrape
the slime and fat from the skin, cleanse the sinews, and
stretch them and the like, when the venison is boiled the
men awake, and opening of their bags take out as much
<em>Indian</em> meal as will serve their turns for the present; they
eat their broth with spoons, and their flesh they divide into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
gobbets, eating now and then with it as much meal as
they can hold betwixt three fingers; their drink they fetch
from the spring, and were not acquainted with other, untill
the <em>French</em> and <em>English</em> traded with that cursed liquor
[p. 139.] called <em>Rum</em>, <em>Rum-bullion</em>, or kill-Devil, which is
stronger than spirit of Wine, and is drawn from the dross
of Sugar and Sugar Canes, this they love dearly, and will
part with all they have to their bare skins for it, being perpetually
drunk with it, as long as it is to be had, it hath
killed many of them, especially old women who have dyed
when dead drunk. Thus instead of bringing of them to
the knowledge of Christianitie, we have taught them to
commit the beastly and crying sins of our Nation, for a
little profit. When the <em>Indians</em> have stuft their paunches,
if it be fair weather and about midday they venture forth
again, but if it be foul and far spent, they betake themselves
to their field-bed at the sign of the Star, expecting
the opening of the Eastern window, which if it promise
serenity, they truss up their fardles, and away for another
<em>Moose</em>, this course they continue for six weeks or two
moneths, making their <em>Webbs</em> their <em>Mules</em> to carry their
luggage, they do not trouble themselves with the horns of
<em>Moose</em> or other <em>Deer</em>, unless it be near an <em>English</em> plantation;
because they are weighty and cumbersome. If the
<em>English</em> could procure them to bring them in, they would
be worth the pains and charge, being sold in <em>England</em>
after the rate of forty or fifty [p. 140.] pounds a Tun;
the red heads of <em>Deer</em> are the fairest and fullest of marrow,
and lightest; the black heads are heavie and have less
marrow; the white are the worst, and the worst nourished.
When the <em>Indians</em> are gone, there gathers to the Carkass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of the <em>Moose</em> thousands of <em>Mattrises</em>, of which there are
but few or none near the Sea-coasts to be seen, these devour
the remainder in a quarter of the time that they
were hunting of it.</p>

<p>Their fishing followes in the spring, summer and fall of
the leaf. First for <em>Lobsters</em>, <em>Clams</em>, <em>Flouke</em>, <em>Lumps</em> or <em>Podles</em>,
and <em>Alewives</em>; afterwards for <em>Bass</em>, <em>Cod</em>, <em>Rock</em>, <em>Blew-fish</em>,
<em>Salmon</em>, and <em>Lampres</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <em>Lobsters</em> they take in large Bayes when it is low
water, the wind still, going out in their <em>Birchen-Canows</em>
with a staff two or three yards long, made small and sharpen’d
at one end, and nick’d with deep nicks to take
hold. When they spye the <em>Lobster</em> crawling upon the
Sand in two fathom water, more or less, they stick him
towards the head and bring him up. I have known thirty
<em>Lobsters</em> taken by an <em>Indian</em> lad in an hour and a half,
thus they take <em>Flouke</em> and <em>Lumps</em>; <em>Clams</em> they dig out of
the <em>Clam-banks</em> upon the flats and in creeks when it is low
water, where they are bedded [p. 141.] sometimes a yard
deep one upon another, the beds a quarter of a mile in
length, and less, the <em>Alewives</em> they take with Nets like a
pursenet put upon a round hoop’d stick with a handle in
fresh ponds where they come to spawn. The <em>Bass</em> and
<em>Blew-fish</em> they take in harbours, and at the mouth of
barr’d Rivers being in their <em>Canows</em>, striking them with a
fisgig, a kind of dart or staff, to the lower end whereof
they fasten a sharp jagged bone (since they make them of
Iron) with a string fastened to it, as soon as the fish is struck
they pull away the staff, leaving the bony head in the
fishes body and fasten the other end of the string to the
<em>Canow</em>: Thus they will hale after them to shore half a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
dozen or half a score great fishes: this way they take
<em>Sturgeon</em>; and in dark evenings when they are upon the
fishing ground near a Bar of Sand (where the <em>Sturgeon</em>
feeds upon small fishes (like <em>Eals</em>) that are called Lances
sucking them out of the Sands where they lye hid, with
their hollow Trunks, for other mouth they have none) the
<em>Indian</em> lights a piece of dry <em>Birch-Bark</em> which breaks out
into a flame &amp; holds it over the side of his <em>Canow</em>, the
<em>Sturgeon</em> seeing this glaring light mounts to the Surface
of the water where he is slain and taken with a fisgig.
<em>Salmons</em> and <em>Lampres</em> [p. 142.] are catch’d at the falls of
Rivers. All the Rivers of note in the Countrey have two
or three desperate falls distant one from another for some
miles, for it being rising ground from the Sea and mountainous
within land, the Rivers having their Originals
from great lakes, and hastning to the Sea, in their passage
meeting with Rocks that are not so easily worn away, as
the loose earthie mould beneath the Rock, makes a fall of
the water in some Rivers as high as a house: you would
think it strange to see, yea admire if you saw the bold
<em>Barbarians</em> in their light <em>Canows</em> rush down the swift and
headlong stream with desperate speed, but with excellent
dexterity, guiding his <em>Canow</em> that seldom or never it shoots
under water, or overturns, if it do they can swim naturally,
striking their pawes under their throat like a dog,
and not spreading their Arms as we do; they turn their
<em>Canow</em> again and go into it in the water.</p>

<p>Their Merchandize are their beads, which are their
money, of these there are two sorts blew Beads and white
Beads, the first is their Gold, the last their Silver, these
they work out of certain shells so cunningly that neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
<em>Jew</em> nor Devil can counterfeit, they dril them and string
them, and make many curious works with them to [p.
143.] adorn the persons of their <em>Sagamours</em> and principal
men and young women, as Belts, Girdles, Tablets, Borders
for their womens hair, Bracelets, Necklaces, and links
to hang in their ears. Prince <em>Phillip</em> a little before I
came for <em>England</em> coming to <em>Boston</em> had a Coat on and
Buskins set thick with these Beads in pleasant wild works
and a broad Belt of the same, his Accoutrements were
valued at Twenty pounds. The <em>English</em> Merchant giveth
them ten shillings a fathom for their white, and as much
more or near upon for their blew Beads. Delicate sweet
dishes too they make of <em>Birch-Bark</em> sowed with threads
drawn from <em>Spruse</em> or white <em>Cedar-Roots</em>, and garnished
on the out-side with flourisht works, and on the brims
with glistering quills taken from the <em>Porcupine</em>, and dyed,
some black, others red, the white are natural, these they
make of all sizes from a dram cup to a dish containing a
pottle, likewise Buckets to carry water or the like, large
Boxes too of the same materials, dishes, spoons and trayes
wrought very smooth and neatly out of the knots of wood,
baskets, bags, and matts woven with <em>Sparke</em>, bark of the
<em>Line-Tree</em> and <em>Rushes</em> of several kinds, dyed as before,
some black, blew, red, yellow, bags of <em>Porcupine</em> quills
woven and dyed also; Coats woven of [p. 144.] <em>Turkie</em>-feathers
for their Children, Tobacco pipes of stone with
Imagerie upon them, Kettles of <em>Birchen-bark</em> which they
used before they traded with the <em>French</em> for Copper Kettles,
by all which you may apparently see that necessity
was at first the mother of all inventions. The women are
the workers of most of these, and are now, here and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
one excellent needle woman, and will milk a Cow neatly,
their richest trade are Furs of divers sorts, Black <em>Fox</em>,
<em>Beaver</em>, <em>Otter</em>, <em>Bear</em>, <em>Sables</em>, <em>Mattrices</em>, <em>Fox</em>, <em>Wild-Cat</em>, <em>Rattoons</em>,
<em>Martins</em>, <em>Musquash</em>, <em>Moose-skins</em>.</p>

<p>Ships they have none, but do prettily imitate ours in
their <em>Birchen-pinnaces</em>, their <em>Canows</em> are made of <em>Birch</em>,
they shape them with flat Ribbs of white <em>Cedar</em>, and cover
them with large sheets of <em>Birch-bark</em>, sowing them through
with strong threds of <em>Spruse-Roots</em> or white <em>Cedar</em>, and
pitch them with a mixture of <em>Turpentine</em> and the hard
rosen that is dryed with the Air on the out-side of the
Bark of <em>Firr-Trees</em>. These will carry half a dozen or
three or four men and a considerable fraight, in these they
swim to Sea twenty, nay forty miles, keeping from the
shore a league or two, sometimes to shorten their voyage
when they are to double a Cape they will put to shore,
and [p. 145.] two of them taking up the <em>Canow</em> carry it
cross the Cape or neck of land to the other side, and to
Sea again; they will indure an incredible great Sea,
mounting upon the working billowes like a piece of
Corke; but they require skilful hands to guide them in
rough weather, none but the <em>Indians</em> scarce dare to undertake
it, such like Vessels the Ancient <em>Brittains</em> used, as
<em>Lucan</em> relates.</p>

<p>[p. 146.] Their Government is monarchical, the Patrueius
or they that descend from the eldest proceeding from
his loyns, is the Roytelet of the Tribe, and if he have
Daughters, his Son dying without a Son, the Government
descends to his Daughters Son: after the same manner,
their lands descend. <em>Cheetadaback</em> was the chief <em>Sachem</em>
or <em>Roytelet</em> of the <em>Massachusets</em>, when the <em>English</em> first set
down there. <em>Massasoit</em>, the great <em>Sachem</em> of the <em>Plimouth
Indians</em>, his dwelling was at a place called <em>Sowans</em>, about
four miles distant from <em>New-Plimouth</em>. <em>Sasasacus</em> was the
chief <em>Sachem</em> of the <em>Pequots</em>, and <em>Mientoniack</em> of the <em>Narragansets</em>.
The chief <em>Roytelet</em> amongst the <em>Mohawks</em> now
living, is a <em>Dutchmans</em> Bastard, and the <em>Roytelet</em> now of
the <em>Pocanakets</em>, that is the <em>Plimouth-Indians</em>, is Prince
<em>Philip</em> alias <em>Metacon</em>, the Grandson of <em>Massasoit</em>. Amongst
the Eastern <em>Indians</em>, <em>Summersant</em> formerly was a famous
<em>Sachem</em>. The now living <em>Sachems</em> of note are <em>Sabaccaman</em>,
<em>Terrumkin</em> and <em>Robinhood</em>.</p>

<p>Their Wars are with Neighbouring Tribes, but the
<em>Mowhawks</em> are enemies to all the other <em>Indians</em>, their
weapons of Defence and Offence are Bowes and Arrowes,
of late he is a poor <em>Indian</em> that is not [p. 147.] master of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
two Guns, which they purchase of the <em>French</em>, and powder
and shot, they are generally excellent marks men;
their other weapons are <em>Tamahawks</em> which are staves two
foot and a half long with a knob at the end as round as
a bowl, and as big as that we call the Jack or Mistriss.
Lances too they have made (as I have said before) with
broken sword blades, likewise they have Hatchets and
knives; but these are weapons of a latter date. They
colour their faces red all over, supposing that it makes
them the more terrible, they are lusty Souldiers to see to
and very strong, meer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hercules Rusticuses</i>, their fights are
by Ambushments and Surprises, coming upon one another
unawares. They will march a hundred miles
through thick woods and swamps to the <em>Mowhawks</em>
Countrey, and the <em>Mowhawks</em> into their Countrey, meeting
sometimes in the woods, or when they come into an
<em>Enemies</em> Countrey build a rude fort with <em>Pallizadoes</em>, having
loop-holes out of which they shoot their Arrowes, and
fire their Guns, pelting at one another a week or moneth
together; If any of them step out of the Fort they are in
danger to be taken prisoners by the one side or the other;
that side that gets the victory excoriats the hair-scalp of the
principal slain Enemies which [p. 148.] they bear away in
Triumph, their prisoners they bring home, the old men
and women they knock in the head, the young women
they keep, and the men of war they torture to death as
the Eastern <em>Indians</em> did two <em>Mowhawks</em> whilst I was there,
they bind him to a Tree and make a great fire before
him, then with sharp knives they cut off the first joynts
of his fingers and toes, then clap upon them hot Embers
to sear the vains; so they cut him a pieces joynt after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
joynt, still applying hot Embers to the place to stanch the
bloud, making the poor wretch to sing all the while:
when Arms and Legs are gone, they flay off the skin of
their Heads, and presently put on a Cap of burning Embers,
then they open his breast and take out his heart,
which while it is yet living in a manner they give to their
old Squaes, who are every one to have a bite at it. These
Barbarous Customs were used amongst them more frequently
before the <em>English</em> came; but since by the great
mercy of the Almighty they are in a way to be Civilized
and converted to Christianity; there being three Churches
of <em>Indians</em> gathered together by the pains of Mr. <em>John
Eliot</em> and his Son, who Preaches to them in their Native
language, and hath rendered the Bible in that Language
for the benefit of [p. 149.] the <em>Indians</em>. These go clothed
like the <em>English</em>, live in framed houses, have stocks of
Corn and Cattle about them, which when they are fat
they bring to the <em>English</em> Markets, the Hogs that they
rear are counted the best in <em>New-England</em>. Some of their
Sons have been brought up Scholars in <em>Harvard</em> Colledge,
and I was told that there was but two Fellowes in
that Colledge, and one of them was an <em>Indian</em>; some few
of these Christian <em>Indians</em> have of late Apostatized and
fallen back to their old Superstition and course of life.</p>

<p>Thus much shall suffice concerning <em>New-England</em>, as it
was when the <em>Indians</em> solely possest it. I will now proceed
to give you an accompt of it, as it is under the management
of the <em>English</em>; but methinks I hear my sceptick
Readers muttering out of their scuttle mouths, what will
accrew to us by this rambling <em>Logodiarce</em>? you do but
bring straw into <em>Egypt</em>, a Countrey abounding with Corn.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Thus by these <em>Famacides</em> who are so minutely curious, I
am dejected from my hope, whilst they challenge the freedom
of <em>David’s</em> Ruffins, Our Tongues are our own, who-shall
controll us. I have done what I can to please you,
I have piped and you will not dance. I have told you as

believe another, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miranda canunt sed non credenda poetæ</i>.
Oh I see the pad, you never heard nor saw the like, therefore
you do not believe me; well Sirs I shall not strain
your belief any further, the following Relation I hope will
be more tolerable, yet I could (it is possible) insert as wonderful
things as any my pen hath yet gone over, and may,
but it must be upon condition you will not put me to the
proof of it. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo tenetur ad impossibilia</i>, no man is

<p><em>New-England</em> was first discovered by <em>John Cabota</em> and
his Son <em>Sebastian</em> in <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1514. A further discovery
afterwards was made by the honourable Sir <em>Walter
Rawleigh</em> Knight in <em>Anno</em> 1584. when as <em>Virginia</em> was
discovered, which together with <em>Mary-land</em>, <em>New-England</em>,
<em>Nova Scotia</em> was known by one common name to the <em>Indians</em>,
<em>Wingandicoa</em>, and by Sir <em>Walter Rawleigh</em> in honour
of our Virgin Queen, in whose name he took possession
of it, <em>Virginia</em>. In [p. 152.] King <em>James</em> his Reign
it was divided into Provinces as is before named. In
1602. these north parts were further discovered by Capt.
<em>Bartholomew Gosnold</em>. The first <em>English</em> that planted
there, set down not far from the <em>Narragansets-Bay</em>, and
called their Colony <em>Plimouth</em>, since old <em>Plimouth</em>, <em>An.
Dom.</em> 1602. Sir <em>John Popham</em> Lord chief Justice authorized
by his Majesty, King <em>James</em>, sent a Colony of <em>English</em>
to <em>Sagadehock</em>, <em>An.</em> 1606. <em>Newfound-land</em> was discovered
by one <em>Andrew Thorn</em> an English man in <em>Anno</em> 1527.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Sir <em>Humphrey Gilbert</em> a west Countrey Knight took possession
of it in the Queens name, <em>Anno</em> 1582. The two
first Colonies in <em>New-England</em> failing, there was a fresh
supply of <em>English</em> who set down in other parts of the
Countrey, and have continued in a flourishing condition
to this day.</p>

<p>The whole Countrey now is divided into Colonies, and
for your better understanding observe, a Colony is a sort
of people that come to inhabit a place before not inhabited,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colonus quasi</i>, because they should be Tillers of
the Earth. From hence by an usual figure the Countrey
where they sit down, is called a Colony or Plantation.</p>

<p>The first of these that I shall relate of, though last in
possession of the <em>English</em>, is now our most Southerly Colony,
and next [p. 153.] adjoyning to <em>Mary-land</em>, <em>scil.</em> the
<em>Manadaes</em> or <em>Manahanent</em> lying upon the great River
<em>Mohegan</em>, which was first discovered by Mr. <em>Hudson</em>, and
sold presently by him to the <em>Dutch</em> without Authority
from his Soveraign the King of <em>England</em>, <em>Anno</em> 1608.
The <em>Dutch</em> in 1614 began to plant there, and call’d it
<em>New-Netherlands</em>, but Sir <em>Samuel Argal</em> Governour of
<em>Virginia</em> routed them, the <em>Dutch</em> after this got leave of
King <em>James</em> to put in there for fresh water in their passage
to <em>Brasile</em>, and did not offer to plant until a good
while after the <em>English</em> were settled in the Countrey. In
<em>Anno</em> 1664 his Majestie <em>Charles</em> the Second sent over four
worthie Gentlemen Commissioners to reduce the Colonies
into their bounds, who had before incroached upon one
another, who marching with Three hundred red-Coats to
<em>Manadaes</em> or <em>Manhataes</em> took from the <em>Dutch</em> their chief
town then called <em>New-Amsterdam</em>, now <em>New York</em>; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Twenty ninth of <em>August</em> turn’d out their Governour with
a silver leg, and all but those that were willing to acknowledge
subjection to the King of <em>England</em>, suffering them
to enjoy their houses and estates as before. Thirteen days
after Sir <em>Robert Carr</em> took the Fort and Town of <em>Aurania</em>
now called <em>Albany</em>; and Twelve days after that, the
Fort and Town [p. 154.] of <em>Awsapha</em>, then <em>De-la-ware</em>
Castle, man’d with <em>Dutch</em> and <em>Sweeds</em>. So now the <em>English</em>
are masters of three handsome Towns, three strong
Forts and a Castle, not losing one man. The first Governour
of these parts for the King of <em>England</em> was
Colonel <em>Nicols</em>, a noble Gentleman, and one of his Majesties
Commissioners, who coming for <em>England</em> in <em>Anno
Dom.</em> 1668 as I take it, surrendered the Government to
Colonel <em>Lovelace</em>.</p>

<p>The Countrey here is bless’d with the richest soil in all
<em>New-England</em>, I have heard it reported from men of
Judgement and Integrity, that one Bushel of <em>European-Wheat</em>
hath yielded a hundred in one year. Their other
Commodities are Furs, and the like.</p>

<p><em>New-York</em> is situated at the mouth of the great River
<em>Mohegan</em>, and is built with <em>Dutch</em> Brick <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alla-moderna</i>,
the meanest house therein being valued at One hundred
pounds, to the Landward it is compassed with a Wall of
good thickness; at the entrance of the River is an Island
well fortified, and hath command of any Ship that shall
attempt to pass without their leave.</p>

<p><em>Albany</em> is situated upon the same River on the West-side,
and is due North from <em>New-York</em> somewhat above
Fifty miles.</p>

<p>[p. 155.] Along the Sea-side Eastward are many <em>English</em>-Towns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
as first <em>Westchester</em>, a Sea-Town about Twenty
miles from <em>New-York</em>; to the Eastward of this is <em>Greenwich</em>,
another Sea-Town much about the same distance;
then <em>Chichester</em>, <em>Fairfield</em>, <em>Stratford</em>, <em>Milford</em>, all Sea-Towns
twenty and thirty mile distant from one another,
twenty miles Eastward of <em>Milford</em> is <em>Newhaven</em> the Metropolis
of the Colony begun in 1637. One Mr. <em>Eaton</em>
being there Governour: it is near to the shoals of <em>Cape
Cod</em>, and is one of the four united Colonies.</p>

<p>The next Sea-Town Eastward of <em>Newhaven</em> is called
<em>Guilford</em> about ten mile, and I think belonging to that
Colony.</p>

<p>From <em>Guilford</em> to <em>Connecticut</em>-River, is near upon
twenty miles, the fresh River <em>Connecticut</em> bears the name
of another Colony begun in the year 1636 and is also one
of the four united Colonies. Upon this River are situated
13 Towns, within two, three &amp; four miles off one
another. At the mouth of the River, on the West-side is
the <em>Lord-Say</em>, and <em>Brooks fort</em>, called <em>Saybrook-fort</em>. Beyond
this Northward is the Town of <em>Windsor</em>, then <em>Northampton</em>,
then <em>Pinsers-house</em>. On the Eastside of the River,
<em>Hartford</em>, about it low land well stored with meadow and
very fertile. <em>Wethersfield</em> is [p. 156.] also situated upon
<em>Connecticut</em>-River and <em>Springfield</em>; but this Town although
here seated is in the jurisdiction of the <em>Mattachusets</em>,
and hath been infamous by reason of Witches therein.
<em>Hadley</em> lyes to the Northward of <em>Springfield</em>. <em>New-London</em>
which I take to be in the jurisdiction of this Coloney
is situated to the Eastward of <em>Connecticut</em>-River by a small
River, and is not far from the Sea. From <em>Connecticut</em>-River
<em>long-Island</em> stretcheth it self to <em>Mohegan</em> one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and twenty miles, but it is but narrow and about sixteen
miles from the main; the considerablest Town upon
it is <em>Southampton</em> built on the Southside of the Island
towards the Eastern end; opposite to this on the Northernside
is <em>Feversham</em>, Westward is <em>Ashford</em>, <em>Huntingdon</em>,
&amp;c. The Island is well stored with Sheep and other Cattle,
and Corn, and is reasonable populous. Between this
Island and the mouth of <em>Connecticut</em>-River lyeth three
small Islands, <em>Shelter-Island</em>, <em>Fishers-Island</em>, and the Isle of
<em>Wight</em>. Over against <em>New-London</em> full South lyeth <em>Block
Island</em>.</p>

<p>The next place of note on the Main is <em>Narragansets-Bay</em>,
within which Bay is <em>Rhode Island</em> a Harbour for the
<em>Shunamitish</em> Brethren, as the Saints Errant, the Quakers
who are rather to be esteemed Vagabonds, than Religious
persons, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>[p. 157.] At the further end of the <em>Bay</em> by the mouth
of <em>Narragansets</em>-River, on the South-side thereof was old
<em>Plimouth</em> plantation <em>Anno</em> 1602. Twenty mile out to Sea,
South of <em>Rhode-Island</em>, lyeth <em>Martins</em> vineyard in the way
to <em>Virginia</em>, this Island is governed by a discreet Gentleman
Mr. <em>Mayhew</em> by name. To the Eastward of <em>Martin’s</em>
vinyard lyeth <em>Nantocket-Island</em>, and further Eastward <em>Elizabeths-Island</em>,
these Islands are twenty or thirty mile asunder,
and now we are come to <em>Cape-Cod</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cape-Cod</em> was so called at the first by Captain <em>Gosnold</em>
and his Company <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1602, because they took
much of that fish there; and afterward was called <em>Cape-James</em>
by Captain <em>Smith</em>: the point of the <em>Cape</em> is called
<em>Point-Cave</em> and <em>Tuckers</em> Terror, and by the <em>French</em> and
<em>Dutch</em> <em>Mallacar</em>, by reason of the perillous shoals. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
first place to be taken notice of on the South-side of the
<em>Cape</em> is <em>Wests</em>-Harbour, the first Sea-Town <em>Sandwich</em> formerly
called <em>Duxbury</em> in the Jurisdiction of <em>New-Plimouth</em>.
Doubling the <em>Cape</em> we come into the great <em>Bay</em>,
on the West whereof is <em>New-Plimouth-Bay</em>, on the South-west-end
of this <em>Bay</em> is situated <em>New Plimouth</em>, the first
<em>English</em>-Colony that took firm possession in this Countrey,
which was in 1620, and the first Town built [p. 158.]
therein, whose longitude is 315 degrees, in latitude 41 degrees
and 37 minutes, it was built nine years before any
other Town, from the beginning of it to 1669 is just forty
years, in which time there hath been an increasing of forty
Churches in this Colony (but many more in the rest,)
and Towns in all <em>New-England</em> one hundred and twenty,
for the most part along the Sea-Coasts, (as being wholsomest)
for somewhat more than two hundred miles:
onely on <em>Connecticut</em>-River (as I have said) is thirteen
Towns not far off one another.</p>

<p>The other Towns of note in this Colony are <em>Green-Harbour</em>
to the Eastward of <em>Plimouth</em> towards the point
of the <em>Cape</em>, &amp; therefore somewhat unaccessible by land,
here is excellent Timber for shipping; then <em>Marshfield</em>,
<em>Yarmouth</em>, <em>Rehoboth</em>, <em>Bridgwater</em>, <em>Warwick</em>, <em>Taunton</em>,
<em>Eastham</em>, by the <em>Indians</em> called <em>Namset</em>.</p>

<p>The first Town Northeast from <em>Green-harbor</em> is <em>Sittuate</em>
in the jurisdiction of the <em>Mattachusets</em>-Colony, more
Northward of <em>Sittuate</em> is <em>Conchusset</em> and <em>Hull</em> a little
Burg lying open to the Sea, from thence we came to
<em>Merton-point</em> over against which is <em>Pullin-point</em>. Upon
<em>Merton-point</em> (which is on the Larboard-side) is a Town
called <em>Nantascot</em>, which is two Leagues from <em>Boston</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
where [p. 159.] Ships commonly cast Anchor. <em>Pullin-point</em>
is so called, because the Boats are by the seasing or
Roads haled against the Tide which is very strong, it is
the usual Channel for Boats to pass into <em>Mattachusets-Bay</em>.</p>

<p>There is an Island on the South-side of the passage
containing eight Acres of ground. Upon a rising hill
within this Island is mounted a Castle commanding the
entrance, no stately Edifice, nor strong; built with Brick
and Stone, kept by a Captain, under whom is a master-Gunner
and others.</p>

<p>The <em>Bay</em> is large, made by many Islands, the chief
<em>Deere</em>-Island, which is within a flight shot of <em>Pullin-point</em>,
great store of <em>Deere</em> were wont to swim thither from the
Main; then <em>Bird</em>-Island, <em>Glass</em>-island, <em>Slate</em>-Island, the
Governours Garden, where the first Apple-Trees in the
Countrey were planted, and a vinyard; then <em>Round</em>-Island,
and <em>Noddles</em>-Island not far from <em>Charles</em>-Town: most
of these Islands lye on the North-side of the <em>Bay</em>.</p>

<p>The next Town to <em>Nantascot</em> on the South-side of the
<em>Bay</em> is <em>Wissaguset</em> a small Village, about three miles from
<em>Mount-wolleston</em>, about this Town the soil is very fertile.</p>

<p>Within sight of this is <em>Mount-wolleston</em> or <em>Merry-mount</em>,
called <em>Massachusets</em>-fields, [p. 160.] where <em>Chicatabat</em> the
greatest <em>Sagamore</em> of the Countrey lived before the
plague: here the Town of <em>Braintree</em> is seated, no Boat
nor Ship can come near to it, here is an Iron mill: to the
West of this Town is <em>Naponset</em> River.</p>

<p>Six miles beyond <em>Braintree</em> lyeth <em>Dorchester</em>, a frontire
Town pleasantly seated, and of large extent into the main
land, well watered with two small Rivers, her body and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
wings filled somewhat thick with houses to the number of
two hundred and more, beautified with fair Orchards and
Gardens, having also plenty of Corn-land, and store of
Cattle, counted the greatest Town heretofore in <em>New-England</em>,
but now gives way to <em>Boston</em>, it hath a Harbour
to the North for Ships.</p>

<p>A mile from <em>Dorchester</em> is the Town of <em>Roxbury</em>, a fair
and handsome Countrey Town, the streets large, the Inhabitants
rich, replenished with Orchards and Gardens,
well watered with springs and small freshets, a brook runs
through it called <em>Smelt</em>-River, a quarter of a mile to the
North-side of the Town runs stony River: it is seated in
the bottom of a shallow <em>Bay</em>, but hath no harbour for
shipping. Boats come to it, it hath store of Land and
Cattle.</p>

<p>Two miles Northeast from <em>Roxbury</em>, and [p. 161.] Forty
miles from <em>New-Plimouth</em>, in the latitude of 42 or 43 degrees
and 10 minutes, in the bottom of <em>Massachusets-Bay</em>
is <em>Boston</em> (whose longitude is 315 degrees, or as others will
322 degrees and 30 seconds.) So called from a Town in
<em>Lincolnshire</em>, which in the <em>Saxons</em> time bare the name of
St. <em>Botolph</em>, and is the Metropolis of this Colony, or rather
of the whole Countrey, situated upon a <em>Peninsula</em>, about
four miles in compass, almost square, and invironed with
the Sea, saving one small <em>Isthmus</em> which gives access to
other Towns by land on the South-side. The Town hath
two hills of equal height on the frontire part thereof next
the Sea, the one well fortified on the superficies with some
Artillery mounted, commanding any Ship as she sails into
the Harbour within the still <em>Bay</em>; the other hill hath a
very strong battery built of whole Timber and fill’d with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
earth, at the descent of the hill in the extreamest part
thereof, betwixt these two strong Arms, lyes a large <em>Cove</em>
or <em>Bay</em>, on which the chiefest part of the Town is built
to the Northwest is a high mountain that out-tops all,
with its three little rising hills on the summit, called
<em>Tramount</em>, this is furnished with a Beacon and great
Guns, from hence you may [p. 162.] overlook all the Islands
in the <em>Bay</em>, and descry such Ships as are upon the
Coast: the houses are for the most part raised on the Sea-banks
and wharfed out with great industry and cost, many
of them standing upon piles, close together on each side
the streets as in <em>London</em>, and furnished with many fair
shops, their materials are Brick, Stone, Lime, handsomely
contrived, with three meeting Houses or Churches, and a
Town-house built upon pillars where the Merchants may
confer, in the Chambers above they keep their monethly
Courts. Their streets are many and large, paved with
pebble stone, and the South-side adorned with Gardens
and Orchards. The Town is rich and very populous,
much frequented by strangers, here is the dwelling of
their Governour. On the North-west and North-east two
constant Fairs are kept for daily Traffick thereunto. On
the South there is a small, but pleasant Common where
the Gallants a little before Sun-set walk with their <em>Marmalet</em>-Madams,
as we do in <em>Morefields</em>, &amp;c. till the nine a
clock Bell rings them home to their respective habitations,
when presently the Constables walk their rounds to
see good orders kept, and to take up loose people. Two
miles from the town, [p. 163.] at a place called <em>Muddy-River</em>,
the Inhabitants have Farms, to which belong rich
arable grounds and meadows where they keep their Cattle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
in the Summer, and bring them to <em>Boston</em> in the Winter;
the Harbour before the Town is filled with Ships
and other Vessels for most part of the year.</p>

<p><em>Hingham</em> is a Town situated upon the Sea-coasts,
South-east of <em>Charles-River</em>: here is great store of Timber,
deal-boards, masts for Ships, white-Cedar, and fish is
here to be had.</p>

<p><em>Dedham</em> an inland town ten miles from <em>Boston</em> in the
County of <em>Suffolk</em> well watered with many pleasant
streams, and abounding with Garden fruit; the Inhabitants
are Husband-men, somewhat more than one hundred
Families, having store of Cattle and Corn.</p>

<p>The Town of <em>Waymouth</em> lyes open to the Sea, on the
East Rocks and Swamps, to the South-ward good store of
<em>Deer</em>, arable land and meadows.</p>

<p>On the North-side of <em>Boston</em> flows <em>Charles-River</em>, which
is about six fathom deep, many small Islands lye to the
Bayward, and hills on either side the River, a very good
harbour, here may forty Ships ride, the passage from <em>Boston</em>
to <em>Charles-Town</em> is by a Ferry worth forty or fifty
pounds a [p. 164.] year, and is a quarter of a mile over.
The River <em>Mistick</em> runs through the right side of the
Town, and by its near approach to <em>Charles-River</em> in one
place makes a very narrow neck, where stands most part
of the Town, the market-place not far from the waterside
is surrounded with houses, forth of which issue two streets
orderly built and beautified with Orchards and Gardens,
their meeting-house stands on the North-side of the market,
having a little hill behind it; there belongs to this
Town one thousand and two hundred Acres of arable,
four hundred head of Cattle, and as many Sheep, these
also provide themselves Farms in the Country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>Up higher in <em>Charles-River</em> west-ward is a broad Bay
two miles over, into which runs <em>Stony-River</em> and <em>Muddy-River</em>.</p>

<p>Towards the South-west in the middle of the <em>Bay</em> is a
great Oyster-bank, towards the North-west is a Creek;
upon the shore is situated the village of <em>Medford</em>, it is a
mile and half from <em>Charles-town</em>.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the <em>Bay</em> the River begins to be narrower,
half a quarter of a mile broad; by the North-side
of the River is <em>New-town</em>, three miles from <em>Charles-town</em>,

to the Southern part of <em>Merrimach-River</em>.</p>

<p>Half a mile thence on the same side of the River is
<em>Water-town</em> built upon one of the branches of <em>Charles-River</em>,
very fruitful and of large extent, watered with
many pleasant springs and small Rivulets, the Inhabitants
live scatteringly. Within half a mile is a great pond divided
between the two Towns, a mile and half from the
Town is a fall of fresh waters which conveigh themselves
into the Ocean through <em>Charles-River</em>, a little below the
fall of waters they have a wair to catch fish, wherein they
take store of <em>Basse</em>, <em>Shades</em>, <em>Alwives</em>, <em>Frost-fish</em>, and <em>Smelts</em>,

small burden may come up to these Towns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>[p. 166.] We will now return to <em>Charles-town</em> again,
where the River <em>Mistick</em> runs on the North-side of the
Town (that is the right side as beforesaid) where on the
Northwest-side of the River is the Town of <em>Mistick</em>, three
miles from <em>Charles-town</em>, a league and half by water, a

<p class="p1">[p. 178.] <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1646. they drew up a body of
their Laws for the well ordering of their Commonwealth,
as they not long since termed it.</p>

<p>The military part of their Commonwealth is governed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
by one Major-General, and three Serjeant Majors; to the
Major-General belongeth particularly the Town of <em>Boston</em>,
to the three Serjeant Majors belong the four Counties,
but with submission to the Major-General. The first
Serjeant Major chosen for the County of <em>Suffolk</em> was Major
<em>Gibbons</em>. For the County of <em>Middlesex</em> Major <em>Sedgwick</em>.
For the County of <em>Essex</em> and <em>Northfolk</em> Major
<em>Denison</em>.</p>

<p>Every Town sends two Burgesses to their great and solemn
general Court.</p>

<p>For being drunk, they either whip or impose a fine of
Five shillings; so for swearing and cursing, or boring
through the tongue with a hot Iron.</p>

<p>For kissing a woman in the street, though in way of
civil salute, whipping or a fine.</p>

<p>For Single fornication whipping or a fine.</p>

<p>For Adultery, put to death, and so for witchcraft.</p>

<p>An <em>English</em> woman suffering an <em>Indian</em> to have carnal
knowledge of her, had an <em>Indian</em> cut out exactly in red
cloth sewed [p. 179.] upon her right Arm, and injoyned
to wear it twelve moneths.</p>

<p>Scolds they gag and set them at their doors for certain
hours, for all comers and goers by to gaze at.</p>

<p>Stealing is punished with restoring four fould, if able;
if not, they are sold for some years, and so are poor
debtors.</p>

<p>If you desire a further inspection to their Laws, I must
refer you to them being in print, too many for to be inserted
into this Relation.</p>

<p>The Governments of their Churches are Independent
and Presbyterial, every Church (for so they call their particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Congregations) have one Pastor, one Teacher, Ruling
Elders and Deacons.</p>

<p>They that are members of their Churches have the
Sacraments administred to them, the rest that are out of
the pale as they phrase it, are denyed it. Many hundred
Souls there be amongst them grown up to men &amp; womens
estate that were never Christened.</p>

<p>They judge every man and woman to pay Five shillings
<em>per</em> day, who comes not to their Assemblies, and impose
fines of forty shillings and fifty shillings on such as
meet together to worship God.</p>

<p>[p. 180.] Quakers they whip, banish, and hang if they
return again.</p>

<p>Anabaptists they imprison, fine and weary out.</p>

<p>The Government both Civil and Ecclesiastical is in the
hands of the thorow-pac’d Independents and rigid Presbyterians.</p>

<p>The grose <em>Goddons</em>, or great masters, as also some of
their Merchants are damnable rich; generally all of their
judgement, inexplicably covetous and proud, they receive
your gifts but as an homage or tribute due to their transcendency,
which is a fault their Clergie are also guilty of,
whose living is upon the bounty of their hearers. On
Sundays in the afternoon when Sermon is ended the
people in the Galleries come down and march two a breast
up one Ile and down the other, until they come before
the desk, for Pulpit they have none: before the desk is a
long pue where the Elders and Deacons sit, one of them
with a mony box in his hand, into which the people as
they pass put their offering, some a shilling, some two shillings,
half a Crown, five shillings according to their ability<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
and good will, after this they conclude with a Psalm;
but this by the way.</p>

<p>The chiefest objects of discipline, Religion, [p. 181.]
and morality they want, some are of a <em>Linsie-woolsie</em>
disposition, of several professions in Religion, all like
<em>Æthiopians</em> white in the Teeth only, full of ludification
and injurious dealing, and cruelty the extreamest of all
vices. The chiefest cause of <em>Noah’s</em> floud, Prov. 27. 26.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agni erant ad vestitum tuum</i>, is a frequent Text among
them, no trading for a stranger with them, but with a <em>Græcian</em>
faith, which is not to part with your ware without
ready money, for they are generally in their payments recusant
and slow, great Syndies, or censors, or controllers
of other mens manners, and savagely factious amongst
themselves.</p>

<p>There are many strange women too, (in <em>Salomon’s</em>
sence) more the pitty, when a woman hath lost her Chastity,
she hath no more to lose.</p>

<p>But mistake me not to general speeches, none but the
guilty take exceptions, there are many sincere and religious
people amongst them, descryed by their charity and
humility (the true Characters of Christianity) by their
Zenodochie or hospitality, by their hearty submission to
their Soveraign the King of <em>England</em>, by their diligent
and honest labour in their callings, amongst these we may
account the Royalists, who are lookt upon with an evil
eye, and [p. 182.] tongue, boulted or punished if they
chance to lash out; the tame <em>Indian</em> (for so they call
those that are born in the Countrey) are pretty honest too,
and may in good time be known for honest Kings men.</p>

<p>They have store of Children, and are well accommodated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
with Servants; many hands make light work, many
hands make a full fraught, but many mouths eat up all,
as some old planters have experimented; of these some
are <em>English</em>, others <em>Negroes</em>: of the <em>English</em> there are can
eat till they sweat, and work till they freeze; &amp; and of the
females that are like Mrs. <em>Winters</em> paddocks, very tender
fingerd in cold weather.</p>

<p>There are none that beg in the Countrey, but there be
Witches too many, bottle-bellied Witches amongst the
Quakers, and others that produce many strange apparitions
if you will believe report, of a <em>Shallop</em> at Sea man’d
with women; of a Ship, and a great red Horse standing
by the main-mast, the Ship being in a small <em>Cove</em> to the
East-ward vanished of a suddain. Of a Witch that appeared
aboard of a Ship twenty leagues to Sea to a Mariner
who took up the Carpenters broad Axe and cleft her
head with it, the Witch dying of the wound at home, with
such like bugbears and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terriculamentaes</i>.</p>

<p>[p. 183.] It is published in print, that there are not much
less than Ten hundred thousand souls <em>English</em>, <em>Scotch</em> and
<em>Irish</em> in <em>New-England</em>.</p>

<p>Most of their first Magistrates are dead, not above two
left in the <em>Massachusets</em>, but one at <em>Plimouth</em>, one at <em>Connecticut</em>,
and one at <em>New-haven</em>, they having done their
generation work are laid asleep in their beds of rest till
the day of doom, there and then to receive their reward
according as they have done be it good or evil. Things
of great indurance we see come to ruine, and alter, as
great Flouds and Seas dryed up; mighty hills and mountains
sunk into hollow bottoms: marvel not then that man
is mortal, since his nature is unconstant and transitory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>The Diseases that the <em>English</em> are afflicted with, are the
same that they have in <em>England</em>, with some proper to
<em>New-England</em>, griping of the belly (accompanied with
Feaver and Ague) which turns to the bloudy-flux, a common
disease in the Countrey, which together with the
small pox hath carried away abundance of their children,
for this the common medicines amongst the poorer sort
are Pills of Cotton swallowed, or Sugar and Sallet-oyl
boiled thick and made into Pills, Alloes pulverized [p.
184.] and taken in the pap of an Apple. I helped many
of them with a sweating medicine only.</p>

<p>Also they are troubled with a disease in the mouth or
throat which hath proved mortal to some in a very short
time, Quinsies, and Impostumations of the Almonds,
with great distempers of cold. Some of our <em>New-England</em>
writers affirm that the <em>English</em> are never or very
rarely heard to sneeze or cough, as ordinarily they do
in <em>England</em>, which is not true. For a cough or stitch
upon cold, Wormwood, Sage, Marygolds, and Crabs-claws
boiled in posset-drink and drunk off very warm, is a soveraign
medicine.</p>

<p>Pleurisies and Empyemas are frequent there, both cured
after one and the same way; but the last is a desperate
disease and kills many. For the Pleurisie I have given
<em>Coriander</em>-seed prepared, <em>Carduus</em> seed, and <em>Harts-horn</em>
pulverized with good success, the dose one dram in a cup
of Wine.</p>

<p>The Stone terribly afflicts many, and the Gout, and
Sciatica, for which take Onions roasted, peeled and stampt,
then boil them with neats-feet oyl and Rhum to a plaister,
and apply it to the hip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>Head-aches are frequent, Palsies, Dropsies, Worms,
Noli-me-tangeres, Cancers, [p. 185.] pestilent Feavers.
Scurvies, the body corrupted with Sea-diet, Beef and Pork
tainted, Butter and Cheese corrupted, fish rotten, a long
voyage, coming into the searching sharpness of a purer
climate, causeth death and sickness amongst them.</p>

<p>Men and Women keep their complexions, but lose
their Teeth: the Women are pittifully Tooth-shaken;
whether through the coldness of the climate, or by sweet-meats
of which they have store, I am not able to affirm,
for the Toothach I have found the following medicine
very available, Brimstone and Gunpowder compounded
with butter, rub the mandible with it, the outside being
first warm’d.</p>

<p>For falling off of the hair occasioned by the coldness of
the climate, and to make it curl, take of the strong water
called Rhum and wash or bath your head therewith, it is
an admirable remedie.</p>

<p>For kibed heels, to heal them take the yellowest part
of Rozen, pulverize it and work it in the palm of your
hand with the tallow of a Candle to a salve, and lay of it
to the sore.</p>

<p>For frozen limbs, a plaister framed with Soap, Bay-salt,
and Molosses is sure, or Cow-dung boiled in milk and
applyed.</p>

<p>For Warts and Corns, bathe them with Sea-water.</p>

<p>[p. 186.] There was in the Countrey not long since living
two men that voided worms seven times their length.
Likewise a young maid that was troubled with a sore
pricking at her heart, still as she lean’d her body, or stept
down with her foot to the one side or the other; this maid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
during her distemper voided worms of the length of a
finger all hairy with black heads; it so fell out that the
maid dyed; her friends desirous to discover the cause of
the distemper of her heart, had her open’d, and found two
crooked bones growing upon the top of the heart, which
as she bowed her body to the right or left side would job
their points into one and the same place, till they had
worn a hole quite through. At <em>Cape-Porpus</em> lived an
honest poor planter of middle-age, and strong of body, but
so extreamly troubled with two lumps (or wens as I conjectured)
within him, on each side one, that he could not
rest for them day nor night, being of great weight, and
swagging to the one side or the other, according to the
motion or posture of his body; at last he dyed in <em>Anno</em>
1668 as I think, or thereabouts. Some Chirurgeons there
were that proffered to open him, but his wife would not
assent to it, and so his disease was hidden in the Grave.</p>

<p>[p. 187.] It is the opinion of many men, that the blackness
of the <em>Negroes</em> proceeded from the curse upon <em>Cham’s</em>
posterity, others again will have it to be the property of
the climate where they live. I pass by other Philosophical
reasons and skill, only render you my experimental
knowledge: having a <em>Barbarie-moor</em> under cure, whose
finger (prickt with the bone of a fish) was Impostumated,
after I had lanc’d it and let out the Corruption the skin
began to rise with proud flesh under it; this I wore away,
and having made a sound bottom I incarnated it, and then
laid on my skinning plaister, then I perceived that the
<em>Moor</em> had one skin more than <em>Englishmen</em>; the skin that
is basted to the flesh is bloudy and of the same Azure colour
with the veins, but deeper than the colour of our <em>Europeans</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
veins. Over this is an other skin of a tawny colour,
and upon that <em>Epidermis</em> or <em>Cuticula</em>, the flower of
the skin (which is that Snakes cast) and this is tawny also,
the colour of the blew skin mingling with the tawny
makes them appear black. I do not peremptorily affirm
this to be the cause, but submit to better judgment. More
rarities of this nature I could make known unto you, but
I hasten to an end; only a word or two of our <em>English</em>
Creatures and then to Sea again.</p>

<p>[p. 188.] I have given you an Account of such plants
as prosper there, and of such as do not; but so briefly,
that I conceive it necessary to afford you some what more
of them. <em>Plantain</em> I told you sprang up in the Countrey
after the <em>English</em> came, but it is but one sort, and that
is broad-leaved plantain.</p>

<p><em>Gilliflowers</em> thrive exceedingly there and are very large,
the Collibuy or humming-Bird is much pleased with
them. Our <em>English</em> dames make Syrup of them without
fire, they steep them in Wine till it be of a deep colour,
and then they put to it spirit of <em>Vitriol</em>, it will keep as
long as the other.</p>

<p><em>Eglantine</em> or sweet <em>Bryer</em> is best sowen with <em>Juniper-berries</em>,
two or three to one <em>Eglantine-berry</em> put into a hole
made with a stick, the next year separate and remove
them to your banks, in three years time they will make a
hedge as high as a man, which you may keep thick and
handsome with cutting.</p>

<p>Our <em>English Clover-grass</em> sowen thrives very well.</p>

<p><em>Radishes</em> I have seen there as big as a man’s Arm.</p>

<p><em>Flax</em> and <em>Hemp</em> flourish gallantly.</p>

<p>Our <em>Wheat</em> i. e. summer <em>Wheat</em> many [p. 189.] times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
changeth into <em>Rye</em>, and is subject to be blasted, some say
with a vapour breaking out of the earth, others, with a
wind North-east or North-west, at such time as it flowereth,
others again say it is with lightning. I have observed,
that when a land of <em>Wheat</em> hath been smitten with a blast
at one Corner, it hath infected the rest in a weeks time, it
begins at the stem (which will be spotted and goes upwards
to the ear making it fruitless): in 1669 the pond
that lyeth between <em>Water-town</em> and <em>Cambridge</em>, cast its
fish dead upon the shore, forc’t by a mineral vapour as
was conjectured.</p>

<p>Our fruit-Trees prosper abundantly, <em>Apple-trees</em>, <em>Pear-trees</em>,
<em>Quince-trees</em>, <em>Cherry-trees</em>, <em>Plum-trees</em>, <em>Barberry-trees</em>.
I have observed with admiration, that the Kernels sown
or the Succors planted produce as fair &amp; good fruit, without
graffing, as the Tree from whence they were taken:
the Countrey is replenished with fair and large Orchards.
It was affirmed by one Mr. <em>Woolcut</em> (a magistrate in <em>Connecticut</em>
Colony) at the Captains Messe (of which I was)
aboard the Ship I came home in, that he made Five hundred
Hogsheads of <em>Syder</em> out of his own Orchard in one
year. <em>Syder</em> is very plentiful in the Countrey, ordinarily
sold for Ten shillings a Hogshead. At the [p. 190.] Tap-houses
in <em>Boston</em> I have had an Ale-quart spic’d and
sweetned with Sugar for a groat, but I shall insert a more
delicate mixture of it. Take of <em>Maligo-Raisons</em>, stamp
them and put milk to them, and put them in an <em>Hippocras</em>
bag and let it drain out of it self, put a quantity of
this with a spoonful or two of Syrup of <em>Clove-Gilliflowers</em>
into every bottle, when you bottle your <em>Syder</em>, and your
Planter will have a liquor that exceeds <em>passada</em>, the Nectar
of the Countrey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>The <em>Quinces</em>, <em>Cherries</em>, <em>Damsons</em>, set the Dames a work,
<em>Marmalad</em> and preserved Damsons is to be met with in
every house. It was not long before I left the Countrey
that I made <em>Cherry wine</em>, and so may others, for there are
good store of them both red and black.</p>

<p>Their fruit-trees are subject to two diseases, the <em>Meazels</em>,
which is when they are burned and scorched with the
Sun, and lowsiness, when the wood-peckers job holes in
their bark: the way to cure them when they are lowsie is
to bore a hole into the main root with an Augur, and
pour in a quantity of Brandie or Rhum, and then stop it
up with a pin made of the same Tree.</p>

<p>The first Neat carried thither was to [p. 191.] <em>New-Plimouth</em>
<em>Anno</em> 1624 these thrive and increase exceedingly,
but grow less in body than those they are bred of
yearly.</p>

<p>Horses there are numerous, and here and there a good
one, they let them run all the year abroad, and in the
winter seldom provide any fother for them, (except it be
Magistrates, great Masters and Troopers Horses) which
brings them very low in flesh till the spring, and so crest
fallen, that their crests never rise again. Here I first met
with that excrescence called <em>Hippomanes</em>, which by some
is said to grow on the forehead of a foal new cast, and
that the Mare bites it off as soon as foaled; but this is but
a fable. A neighbour at <em>Black-point</em> having a Mare with
foal, tyed her up in his Barn, the next day she foaled, and
the man standing by spied a thing like a foals tongue to
drop out of the foals mouth, which he took up and presented
me with it, telling me withall, that he had heard
many wonderful things reported of it, and that it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
rank poyson. I accepted of it gladly and brought it home
with me, when it was dry, it lookt like Glew, but of a dark
brown colour; to omit all other uses for it, this I can assure
you that a piece of it soakt in warm water or cold,
will take spots out of wollen Clothes being rub’d thereon.</p>

<p>[p. 192.] <em>Goats</em> were the first small Cattle they had in
the Countrey, he was counted no body that had not a
Trip or Flock of <em>Goats</em>: a hee-<em>Goat</em> gelt at <em>Michaelmas</em>
and turn’d out to feed will be fat in a moneths time, &amp; is
as good meat as a weather. I was taught by a <em>Barbary
Negro</em> a medicine which before I proceed any further I
will impart unto you, and that was for a swelling under
the throat. Take <em>Goats</em> hair and clay and boil them in
fair water to a poultis, and apply it very warm.</p>

<p><em>Sheep</em> now they have good store, these and <em>Goats</em> bring
forth two, sometimes three <em>Lambs</em> and <em>Kids</em> at a time.</p>

<p><em>Hoggs</em> are here innumerable, every planter hath a
Heard, when they feed upon shell-fish and the like, as
they do that are kept near the Sea and by the fishers
stages, they tast fishie and rank; but fed with white Oak-Acorns,
or <em>Indian</em>-Corn and Pease there is not better
Pork in the whole world: besides they sometimes have
the <em>Meazels</em>, which is known when their hinder legs are
shorter than ordinary.</p>

<p><em>Catts</em> and <em>Dogs</em> are as common as in <em>England</em>, but our
<em>Dogs</em> in time degenerate; yet they have gallant <em>Dogs</em> both
for fowl &amp; wild Beasts all over the Countrey: the <em>Indians</em>
store themselves with them, being much [p. 193.] better
for their turns, than their breed of wild dogs, which are
(as I conceive) like to the <em>Tasso</em>-canes or mountain dogs
in <em>Italy</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>Of <em>English</em> Poultry too there is good store, they have
commonly three broods in a year; the hens by that time
they are three years old have spurs like the Cock, but not
altogether so big, but as long, they use to crow often,
which is so rare a thing in other Countries, that they have
a proverb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallina recinit</i> a Hen crowes. And in <em>England</em>
it is accounted ominous; therefore our Farmers wives
as soon as they hear a Hen crow wring off her neck,
and so they serve their spur’d Hens, because they should
not break their Eggs with their spurs when they sit. In
the year 1637. which was when I went my first Voyage to
<em>New-England</em> a good woman brought aboard with her a
lusty Cock and Hen that had horns like spurs growing out
on each side of their Combs, but she spoiled the breed, killing
of them at Sea, to feed upon, for she loved a fresh bit.</p>

<p>In <em>Anno</em> 1647/8. Certain <em>Indians</em> coming to our house
clad in <em>Deere-skin</em> coats, desired leave to lodge all night
in our kitchin, it being a very rainie season, some of them
lay down in the middle of the Room, and others under
the Table, in the morning they [p. 194.] went away before
any of the people were up; the poultry had their breakfast
usually in cold weather in the kitchin, and because
they should not hinder the passing of the people too and
again, it was thrown under the Table; in the afternoon
they began to hang the wing, in the night the sickest
dropt dead from the perch, and the next day most of them
dyed; we could not of a sudden ghess at the cause, but
thought the <em>Indians</em> had either bewitched, or poysoned
them: it came at last into my head, seeing their Crops
very full, or rather much swell’d, to open them, where I
found as much <em>Deers</em> hair as Corn, they that pickt up
none of the hair lived and did well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>In the year 1667. <em>October</em> the 7th amongst our poultry
we had one white game Cock of the <em>French</em> kind, a bird
of high price, when he was three years old he drooped
and his spirit was quite gone; one of our <em>Negro</em> maids
finding him in the yard dead brought him into the house
and acquainted me with it. I caused her to draw him,
when his guts were all drawn out she put in her hand
again and felt a lump in his body as big as a half-peny
loaf, strongly fastned to his back, and much ado she had
to pull it out; I found it to be a tuff bag, containing stuff
like liver, and very heavie, at one end [p. 195.] of the bag,
another little bag filled with a fatty matter, his gizard,
liver, and heart wasted. The Pipe or Roupe is a common
disease amongst their poultry infecting one another with
it. I conceive it cometh of a cold moisture of the brain,
they will be very sleepie with it, the best cure for it is <em>Garlick</em>,
and smoaking of them with dryed <em>Hysope</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>September</em> following my Arrivage in the <em>Massachusets</em>
about the twelfth hour of the eight day, I shipt my
self and goods in a Bark bound to the East-ward, meeting
as we sailed out the <em>Dutch</em> Governour of <em>New-Netherlands</em>,
who was received and entertained at <em>Boston</em> by the
Governour and Magistrates with great solemnity. About
nine of the clock at night we came to <em>Salem</em> and lay
aboard all night.</p>

<p>The Ninth day we went ashore to view the Town which
is a mile long, and lay that night at a Merchants house.</p>

<p>The Tenth day we came from <em>Salem</em> about twelve of
the clock back to <em>Marble-head</em>: here we went ashore and
recreated our selves with Musick and a cup of Sack and
saw the Town, about ten at night we returned to our
Bark and lay aboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>The Eleventh being Saturday, and the wind contrary,
we came to <em>Charles-town</em>, [p. 196.] again about twelve
of the clock we took store of <em>Mackarel</em>.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth being Monday, we went aboard again
about nine of the clock in the morning and out to Sea,
about Sun going down we took store of <em>Mackarel</em>. The</p>

<p>wind was scanty all along, and in the night time we durst
not bear much sail, because of the Rocks and foaming
breakers that lay in our way.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth day we came up with <em>Pascataway</em>, or
<em>Pascatique</em>, where there is a large River and a fair harbour,
within here is seated a Colony, properly belonging
to the Heirs of Captain <em>Mason</em> sometime since of <em>London</em>;
but taken into the Colony of <em>Massachusets</em>, by what
right I will not here discuss.</p>

<p>The chiefest places of note are the <em>Bay</em> or <em>Harbour</em>
North from <em>Boston</em>, on the West-side of the Harbour are
built many fair houses, and so in another part called
<em>Strawberry-bank</em>.</p>

<p>By the Harbour is an Island which of late days is filled
with buildings, besides there are two Towns more seated
up higher upon the River, the one called <em>Dover</em>; the
River-banks are clothed with stately Timber, and here are
two miles meadow land and arable enough; the other
town is called <em>Excester</em>.</p>

<p>[p. 197.] At the River <em>Pascataway</em> begins the Province
of <em>Main</em>: having pleased our selves with the sight of <em>Pascataway</em>
at a distance we sailed on, and came to <em>Black-point</em>.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth day, about eight of the clock at night,
where the next day I was shrewdly pinched with a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
frost, but having two or three bottles of excellent <em>Passada</em>,
and good cheer bestowed upon me I made a shift to bear
it out, and now we are in the Province of <em>Main</em>.</p>

<p>The Province of <em>Main</em>, (or the Countrey of the <em>Traquoes</em>)
heretofore called <em>Laconia</em> or <em>New-Summersetshire</em>,
is a Colony belonging to the Grandson of Sir <em>Ferdinando
Gorges</em> of <em>Ashton Phillips</em> in the County of <em>Sommerset</em>,
the said Sir <em>Ferdinando Gorges</em> did expend in planting
several parts of <em>New-England</em> above Twenty thousand
pounds <em>sterling</em>; and when he was between three and four
score years of age did personally engage in our Royal
Martyrs service; and particularly in the Seige of <em>Bristow</em>,
and was plundered and imprisoned several times, by reason
whereof he was discountenanced by the pretended Commissioners
for forraign plantations, and his Province incroached
upon by the <em>Massachusets</em> Colony, who assumed
the Government thereof. His Majestie that now Reigneth
sent over his [p. 198.] Commissioners to reduce them
within their bounds, and to put Mr. <em>Gorges</em> again into
possession. But there falling out a contest about it, the
Commissioners settled it in the Kings name (until the business
should be determined before his Majestie) and gave
Commissions to the Judge of their Courts, and the Justices
to Govern and Act according to the Laws of <em>England</em>,
&amp; by such Laws of their own as were not repugnant
to them: But as soon as the Commissioners were returned
for <em>England</em>, the <em>Massachusets</em> enter the province in a hostile
manner with a Troop of Horse and Foot and turn’d
the Judge and his Assistants off the Bench, Imprisoned
the Major or Commander of the Militia, threatned the
Judge, and some others that were faithful to Mr. <em>Gorges</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
interests. I could discover many other foul proceedings,
but for some reasons which might be given, I conceive it
not convenient to make report thereof to vulgar ears; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">&amp;
quæ supra nos nihil ad nos</i>. Onely this I could wish, that
there might be some consideration of the great losses,
charge and labour which hath been sustained by the
Judge, and some others for above thirty years in upholding
the rights of Mr. <em>Gorge</em> and his Sacred Majesties Dominion
against a many stubborn and elusive people.</p>

<p>[p. 199.] <em>Anno Dom.</em> 1623. Mr. <em>Robert Gorge</em>, Sir
<em>Ferdinando Gorges</em> brother had for his good service
granted him by Patent from the Council of <em>Plimouth</em> all
that part of the Land commonly called <em>Massachusiack</em>,
situated on the North-side of the Bay of <em>Massachusets</em>.</p>

<p>Not long after this Sir <em>Ferdinando Gorges</em> had granted
to him by Patent from the middest of <em>Merrimack</em>-River to
the great River <em>Sagadehock</em>, then called <em>Laconia</em>.</p>

<p>In 1635. Capt. <em>William Gorge</em>, Sir <em>Ferdinando’s</em>
Nephew, was sent over Governour of the Province of
<em>Main</em>, then called <em>New-Summersetshire</em>.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Ferdinando Gorge</em> received a Charter-Royal from
King <em>Charles</em> the first the third of <em>April</em> <ins class="corr" id="tn-152" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;1674 text: 'in the Fifttenth'">
in the Fifteenth</ins>
of his Raign, granting to him all that part and portion of
<em>New-England</em>, lying and being between the River of <em>Pascataway</em>,
that is, beginning at the entrance of <em>Pascataway-harbour</em>,
and so to pass up the same into the River of
<em>Newichawanoe</em> or <em>Neqhechewanck</em>, and through the same
unto the farthest head thereof aforesaid, North-eastward
along the Sea-coasts, for Sixty miles to <em>Sagadehoc</em>-River
to <em>Kenebeck</em>, even as far as the head thereof, and up into
the main land North-westward for the space of one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
and twenty [p. 200.] miles. To these Territories are
adjoyned the North half-Isle of <em>Sholes</em>, with several other
Islands, it lyeth between 44 degrees and 45 of Northerly
latitude. The River <em>Canada</em> on the North-east the Sea
coast South, amongst many large Royalties, Jurisdictions
and Immunities was also granted to the said Sir <em>Ferdinando
Gorge</em>, the same Royalties, priviledges and franchises as
are, or of right ought to be enjoyed by the Bishop of
<em>Durham</em> in the County Palatine of <em>Durham</em>; the planters
to pay for every hundred Acres of land yearly, two shillings
six pence, that is such land as is given to them and
their Heirs for ever.</p>

<p>The Officers by Patent are a Deputy Governour, a
Chancellor, a Treasurer, a Marshal for Souldiers, an Admiraltie
for Sea affairs, and a Judge of the Admiraltie, a
Master of Ordinance, a Secretary, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>

<p>Towns there are not many in this province. <em>Kittery</em>
situated not far from <em>Pascataway</em> is the most populous.</p>

<p>Next to that Eastward is seated by a River near the Sea
<em>Gorgiana</em>, a Majoraltie, and the Metropolitan of the province.</p>

<p>Further to the Eastward is the Town of <em>Wells</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cape-Porpus</em> Eastward of that, where there is a Town
by the Sea side of the same name, [p. 201.] the houses
scatteringly built, all these Towns have store of salt and
fresh marsh with arable land, and are well stockt with
Cattle.</p>

<p>About eight or nine mile to the East-ward of <em>Cape-Porpus</em>,
is <em>Winter harbour</em>, a noted place for Fishers, here
they have many stages.</p>

<p><em>Saco</em> adjoyns to this, and both make one scattering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Town of large extent, well stored with Cattle, arable land
and marshes, and a Saw-mill.</p>

<p>Six mile to the Eastward of <em>Saco</em> &amp; forty mile from
<em>Gorgiana</em> is seated the Town of <em>Black point</em>, consisting of
about fifty dwelling houses, and a Magazine or <em>Doganne</em>,
scatteringly built, they have store of neat and horses, of
sheep near upon Seven or Eight hundred, much arable
and marsh salt and fresh, and a Corn-mill.</p>

<p>To the Southward of the <em>point</em> (upon which are stages
for fishermen) lye two small Islands beyond the point,
North-eastward runs the River <em>Spurwinch</em>.</p>

<p>Four miles from <em>Black-point</em>, one mile from <em>Spurwinch</em>-River
Eastward lyeth <em>Richmans-Island</em>, whose longitude is
317 degrees 30 seconds, and latitude 43 degrees and 34
minutes, it is three mile in circumference, and hath a passable
and gravelly ford on the [p. 202.] North-side, between
the main and the Sea at low-water: here are found
excellent Whetstones, and here likewise are stages for fishermen.</p>

<p>Nine mile Eastward of <em>Black-point</em> lyeth scatteringly
the Town of <em>Casco</em> upon a large Bay, stored with Cattle,
Sheep, Swine, abundance of marsh and Arable land, a
Corn-mill or two, with stages for fishermen.</p>

<p>Further East-ward is the Town of <em>Kenebeck</em> seated upon
the River.</p>

<p>Further yet East-ward is <em>Sagadehock</em>, where there are
many houses scattering, and all along stages for fishermen,
these too are stored with Cattle and Corn lands.</p>

<p>The mountains and hills that are to be taken notice of,
are first <em>Acomenticus</em> hills, between <em>Kettery</em> and <em>Gorgiana</em>,
the high hills of <em>Ossapey</em> to the West-ward of <em>Saco</em> River,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
where the princely <em>Pilhanaw</em> Ayries, the white mountains,
to the North-ward of <em>Black-point</em>, the highest <em>Terrasse</em>
in <em>New-England</em>, you have the description of it in
my Treatise of the rarities of <em>New-England</em>.</p>

<p>A Neighbour of mine rashly wandering out after some
stray’d Cattle, lost his way, and coming as we conceived
by his Relation near to the head spring of some of the
branches of <em>Black-point</em> River or <em>Saco</em>-River, [p. 203.]
light into a Tract of land for God knowes how many
miles full of delfes and dingles, and dangerous precipices,
Rocks and inextricable difficulties which did justly daunt,
yea quite deter him from endeavouring to pass any further:
many such like places are to be met with in <em>New-England</em>.</p>

<p>The ponds or lakes in this province are very large and
many, out of which the great Rivers have their original;
we read of the lake <em>Balsena</em> that is thirty miles about,
here are that come very near to it, stored with all sorts
of fresh water fish; and if you will believe report, in
one of them huge fishes like Whales are to be seen, and
some of them have fair Islands in them. Twelve mile
from <em>Casco-bay</em>, and passable for men and horses, is a lake
called by the <em>Indians</em> <em>Sebug</em>, on the brink thereof at one
end is the famous Rock shap’d like a <em>Moose-Deere</em> or <em>Helk</em>,
Diaphanous, and called the <em>Moose-Rock</em>. Here are found
stones like Crystal, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lapis Specularis</i> or <em>Muscovia</em> glass
both white and purple.</p>

<p>On the East-side of <em>Black-point</em> River, upon a plain,
close to the Sea-bank is a pond two mile in compass, fish
it produceth, but those very small and black, and a number
of Frogs and Snakes, and much [p. 204.] frequented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
by wild-fowl, <em>Ducks</em>, <em>Teal</em>, and wild-<em>Swins</em>, and <em>Geese</em>, especially
spring and fall when they pass along to the South-ward,
and return again to the North-ward where they
breed.</p>

<p>The principal Rivers in the province of <em>Main</em>, are <em>Pascataway</em>-River,
<em>York</em>-River, <em>Kenibunck</em>-River, near to this
River clay bullets were cast up by a mineral vapour, this
River is by the Town of <em>Wells</em>. Then <em>Saco</em>-River on the
East-side of the Town, the shore Rockie all along on both
sides, where musick echoes from several places: seven
miles up the River is a great fall where abundance of
<em>Salmon</em> and <em>Lamprons</em> are taken at the fall; a great way
up, the River runs upon the Rock, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in rupibus defendendo
efficit rivos</i>, he cutteth out Rivers among the Rocks, saith
<em>Job</em>, of the Almighty, <em>Job</em> 28. 10. A little above the fall
is a saw-mill. Then <em>Black-point</em>-River divided into many
branches; this as most of the Rivers in <em>New-England</em>, is
bar’d with a bank of Sand, where the <em>Indians</em> take <em>Sturgeon</em>
and <em>Basse</em>. <em>Spur-winck</em>-River is next, which by his
near approach to <em>Black-point</em>-River maketh that neck of
land almost an Island. Further East-ward is <em>Kenebeck</em>-river
fifty leagues off of <em>New-Plimouth</em> East-ward, and
<em>Pechipscut</em> famous [p. 205.] for multitudes of mighty large
<em>Sturgeon</em>. The last river of the province East-ward is the
great river <em>Sagadehock</em> where Sir <em>John Pophams</em> Colony
seated themselves.</p>

<p>The chief harbours are <em>Cape-porpus</em>, <em>Winter harbour</em>,
in which are some small Islands, <em>Black-point</em>, <em>Richmans-Island</em>,
<em>Casco-bay</em> the largest in the province full of Islands.</p>

<p>From <em>Sagadehock</em> to <em>Nova-Scotia</em> is called the Duke of
<em>Yorkes</em> province, here <em>Pemmaquid</em>, <em>Montinicus</em>, <em>Mohegan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
apeanawhagen</em>, where Capt. <em>Smith</em> fisht for <em>Whales</em>;
<em>Muscataquid</em>, all fill’d with dwelling houses and stages for
fishermen, and have plenty of Cattle, arable land and
marshes.</p>

<p><em>Nova Scotia</em> was sold by the Lord <em>Starling</em> to the
<em>French</em>, and is now wholly in their possession.</p>

<p>Now we are come to <em>New-found-land</em>, which is over
against the gulf of St. <em>Lawrence</em>, an Island near as spacious
as <em>Ireland</em>, and lyeth distant from the Continent as
far as <em>England</em> is from the nearest part of <em>France</em>, and
near half the way between <em>Ireland</em> and <em>Virginia</em>, its longitude
is 334 degrees 20 seconds, and North latitude 46
degrees 30 minutes, or as others will 53 minutes. <em>The
longitude of places are uncertainly reported, but in latitudes
most agree.</em> [p. 206.] <em>Longitude is the distance of the meridian
of any place from the meridian which passeth over
the Isles of</em> Azores, <em>where the beginning of longitude is said
to be. The meridian is a great circle dividing the Equinoctial
at right Angles into two equal parts, passing also
through both the Poles, and the Zenith, to which circle the
Sun coming twice every 24 hours, maketh the middle of the
day, and the middle of the night. Every place hath a several
meridian, but they all meet in the poles of the world.
Latitude is counted from the Equinoctial to the end of 30
degrees on each side thereof. The Equinoctial is a great
circle imagined in the Heavens, also dividing the heavens
into two equal parts, and lying just in the middle betwixt
the two poles, being in compass from West to East, 360 degrees,
every degree thereof on the terrestrial Globe valuing
<a id="tn-157"></a>20 English miles, [leagues?] or 60 miles.</em></p>

<p>Into the Bay of St. <em>Lawrence</em> the River of St. <em>Lawrence</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
or <em>Canada</em> disimbogues it self, a River far exceeding any
River in the elder world, thirty or forty mile over at the
mouth, and in the Channel one hundred fathom deep; it
runs on the back-side of <em>New-England</em> and <em>Virginia</em>: the
<em>French</em> (it is said) have gone up six weeks voyage in it,
and have not yet discovered the spring-head: the longitude
is 334 degrees [p. 207.] 11 seconds, in 50 degrees 21
minutes of North latitude. This may satisfie a modest
Reader, and I hope yield no offence to any. I shall onely
speak a word or two of the people in the province of
<em>Main</em> and the Dukes province, and so conclude.</p>

<p>The people in the province of <em>Main</em> may be divided
into Magistrates, Husbandmen, or Planters, and fishermen;
of the Magistrates some be Royalists, the rest perverse
Spirits, the like are the planters and fishers, of which
some be planters and fishers both, others meer fishers.</p>

<p>Handicrafts-men there are but few, the Tumelor or
Cooper, Smiths and Carpenters are best welcome
amongst them, shop-keepers there are none, being supplied
by the <em>Massachusets</em> Merchants with all things they
stand in need of, keeping here and there fair Magazines
stored with <em>English</em> goods, but they set excessive prices on
them, if they do not gain <em>Cent per Cent</em>, they cry out that
they are losers, hence <em>English</em> shooes are sold for Eight
and Nine shillings a pair, worsted stockins of Three shillings
six pence a pair, for Seven and Eight shillings a pair,
Douglass that is sold in <em>England</em> for one or two and
twenty pence an ell, for four shillings a yard, Serges of
two shillings or three shillings a yard, for Six and Seven
[p. 208.] shillings a yard, and so all sorts of Commodities
both for planters and fishermen, as Cables, Cordage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Anchors, Lines, Hooks, Nets, Canvas for sails, <em>&amp;c.</em> Bisket
twenty five shillings a hundred, Salt at an excessive
rate, pickled-herrin for winter bait Four and five pound a
barrel (with which they speed not so well as the waggish
lad at <em>Cape-porpus</em>, who baited his hooks with the drown’d
<em>Negro’s</em> buttocks) so for Pork and Beef.</p>

<p>The planters are or should be restless pains takers, providing
for their Cattle, planting and sowing of Corn, fencing
their grounds, cutting and bringing home fuel, cleaving
of claw-board and pipe-staves, fishing for fresh water
fish and fowling takes up most of their time, if not all; the
diligent hand maketh rich, but if they be of a droanish
disposition as some are, they become wretchedly poor and
miserable, scarce able to free themselves and family from
importunate famine, especially in the winter for want of
bread.</p>

<p>They have a custom of taking Tobacco, sleeping at
noon, sitting long at meals some-times four times in a day,
and now and then drinking a dram of the bottle extraordinarily:
the smoaking of Tobacco, if moderately used
refresheth the weary much, and so doth sleep.</p>

<p>The Physitian allowes but three draughts at a meal, the
first for need, the second for pleasure, and the third for
sleep; but little observed by them, unless they have no
other liquor to drink but water. In some places where
the springs are frozen up, or at least the way to their
springs made unpassable by reason of the snow and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
like, they dress their meat in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Cælestis</i>, i. e. melted
snow, at other times it is very well cook’t, and they feed
upon (generally) as good flesh, Beef, Pork, Mutton, Fowl
and fish as any is in the whole world besides.</p>

<p>Their Servants which are for the most part <em>English</em>,
when they are out of their time, will not work under half
a Crown a day, although it be for to make hay, and for
less I do not see how they can, by reason of the dearness
of clothing. If they hire them by the year, they pay
them Fourteen or Fifteen pound, yea Twenty pound at
the years end in Corn, Cattle and fish: some of these
prove excellent fowlers, bringing in as many as will maintain
their masters house; besides the profit that accrews
by their feathers, [p. 210.] They use (when it is to be
had) a great round shot, called <em>Barstable</em> shot, (which is
best for fowl) made of a lead blacker than our common
lead, to six pound of shot they allow one pound of powder,
Cannon powder is esteemed best.</p>

<p>The fishermen take yearly upon the coasts many hundred
kentals of Cod, hake, haddock, polluck <em>&amp;c.</em> which
they split, salt and dry at their stages, making three voyages
in a year. When they share their fish (which is at the
end of every voyage) they separate the best from the worst,
the first they call Merchantable fish, being sound, full grown
fish and well made up, which is known when it is clear
like a Lanthorn horn and without spots; the second sort
they call refuse fish, that is such as is salt burnt, spotted,
rotten, and carelesly ordered: these they put off to the
<em>Massachusets</em> Merchants; the merchantable for thirty and
two and thirty ryals a kental, (a kental is an hundred and
twelve pound weight) the refuse for Nine shillings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Ten shillings a kental, the Merchant sends the merchantable
fish to <em>Lisbonne</em>, <em>Bilbo</em>, <em>Burdeaux</em>, <em>Marsiles</em>, <em>Talloon</em>,
<em>Rochel</em>, <em>Roan</em>, and other Cities of <em>France</em>, to the <em>Canaries</em>
with claw-board and pipe-staves which is there and at the
<em>Charibs</em> a prime Commodity: the refuse fish they put [p.
211.] off at the <em>Charib-Islands</em>, <em>Barbadoes</em>, <em>Jamaica</em>, &amp;c.
who feed their <em>Negroes</em> with it.</p>

<p>To every Shallop belong four fishermen, a Master or
Steersman, a Midship-man, and a Foremast-man, and a
shore man who washes it out of the salt, and dries it upon
hurdles pitcht upon stakes breast high and tends their
Cookery; these often get in one voyage Eight or Nine
pound a man for their shares, but it doth some of them
little good, for the Merchant to increase his gains by putting
off his Commodity in the midst of their voyages, and
at the end thereof comes in with a walking Tavern, a
Bark laden with the Legitimate bloud of the rich grape,
which they bring from <em>Phial</em>, <em>Madera</em>, <em>Canaries</em>, with
<em>Brandy</em>, <em>Rhum</em>, the <em>Barbadoes strong-water</em>, and <em>Tobacco</em>,
coming ashore he gives them a taster or two, which so
charms them, that for no perswasions that their imployers
can use will they go out to Sea, although fair and seasonable
weather, for two or three days, nay sometimes a
whole week till they are wearied with drinking, taking
ashore two or three Hogsheads of <em>Wine</em> and <em>Rhum</em> to
drink off when the Merchant is gone. If a man of quality
chance to come where they are roystering and gulling
in <em>Wine</em> with a dear felicity, he must be sociable and <em>Roly-poly</em>
with them, taking off [p. 212] their liberal cups as
freely, or else be gone, which is best for him, for when
<em>Wine</em> in their guts is at full Tide, they quarrel, fight and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
do one another mischief, which is the conclusion of their
drunken compotations. When the day of payment comes,
they may justly complain of their costly sin of drunkenness,
for their shares will do no more than pay the reckoning;
if they save a Kental or two to buy shooes and
stockins, shirts and wastcoats with, ’tis well, other-wayes
they must enter into the Merchants books for such things
as they stand in need off, becoming thereby the Merchants
slaves, &amp; when it riseth to a big sum are constrained to
mortgage their plantation if they have any, the Merchant
when the time is expired is sure to seize upon their plantation
and stock of Cattle, turning them out of house and
home, poor Creatures, to look out for a new habitation in
some remote place where they begin the world again.
The lavish planters have the same fate, partaking with
them in the like bad husbandry, of these the Merchant
buys Beef, Pork, Pease, Wheat and <em>Indian</em> Corn, and sells
it again many times to the fishermen. Of the same nature
are the people in the Dukes province, who not long
before I left the Countrey petitioned the Governour and
Magistrates in [p. 213.] the <em>Massachusets</em> to take them
into their Government, Birds of a feather will ralley together.</p>

<p><em>Anno Dom.</em> 1671. The year being now well spent, and
the Government of the province turned topsiturvy, being
heartily weary and expecting the approach of winter, I
took my leave of my friends at <em>Black-point</em>. And on the
28 of <em>August</em> being Monday I shipt my self and my goods
aboard of a shallop bound for <em>Boston</em>: towards Sun-set,
the wind being contrary, we put into <em>Gibbons</em> his Island,
a small Island in <em>Winter-harbour</em> about two leagues from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
<em>Black-point</em> West-ward, here we stayed till the 30. day being
Wednesday, about nine of the clock we set sail, and
towards Sun-set came up with <em>Gorgiana</em>, the 31 day being
Thursday we put into <em>Cape-Ann</em>-harbour about Sun-set.
<em>September</em> the 1 being Saturday in the morning before
day we set sail and came to <em>Boston</em> about three of the
clock in the afternoon, where I found the Inhabitants
exceedingly afflicted with griping of the guts, and Feaver,
and Ague, and bloudy Flux.</p>

<p>The Eight day of <em>October</em> being Wednesday, I boarded
the new-Supply of <em>Boston</em> 120 Tun, a ship of better sail
than defence, her Guns being small, and for salutation
only, the Master Capt. <em>Fairweather</em>, her [p. 214.] sailers
16. and as many passengers. Towards night I returned
to <em>Boston</em> again, the next day being Thanksgiving day, on
Fryday the Tenth day we weighed Anchor and fell down
to <em>Hull</em>.</p>

<p>The 12 and 13 day about 20 leagues from <em>Cape-Sable</em> a
bitter storm took us, beginning at seven of the clock at
night, which put us in terrible fear of being driven upon
the <em>Cape</em>, or the Island of <em>Sables</em> where many a tall ship
hath been wrackt.</p>

<p><em>November</em> the One and twenty about two of the clock
afternoon we saw within kenning before us thick clouds,
which put us in hope of land, the <em>Boson</em> brings out his
purse, into which the passengers put their good will, then
presently he nails it to the main-mast, up go the boyes to
the main-mast-top sitting there like so many <em>Crowes</em>, when
after a while one of them cryes out land, which was glad
tidings to the wearied passengers, the boyes descend, and
the purse being taken from the mast was distributed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
amongst them, the lad that first descryed land having a
double share: about three of the clock <em>Scilly</em> was three
leagues off.</p>

<p>The four and twentieth day we came to <em>Deal</em>, from
thence the 25. to <em>Lee</em>, the 26. being Sunday we steemed
the Tide to <em>Gravesend</em>, about two of the clock [p. 215.]
afternoon. The 27 we came up with <em>Wollich</em> where I
landed and refresht my self for that night, next day I
footed it four or five miles to <em>Bexley</em> in <em>Kent</em> to visit a
near kinsman, the next day proved rainie, the 30 day being
Fryday my kinsman accommodated me with a Horse
and his man to <em>Greenwich</em>, where I took a pair of Oars
and went aboard our Ship then lying before <em>Radcliff</em>, here
I lay that night. Next day being Saturday, and the first
of <em>December</em> I cleared my goods, shot the bridge and
landed at the <em>Temple</em> about seven of the clock at night,
which makes my voyage homeward 7 weeks and four
days, and from my first setting out from <em>London</em> to my
returning to <em>London</em> again Eight years Six moneths and
odd days.</p>

<p>Now by the merciful providence of the Almighty, having
perform’d Two voyages to the North-east parts of the
Western-world, I am safely arrived in my Native Countrey;
having in part made good the <em>French</em> proverb,
Travail where thou canst, but dye where thou oughtest,
that is, in thine own Countrey.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><em>The Terrestrial World is by our learned Geographers
divided into four parts</em>, Europe, Asia,
Africa <em>and</em> America <em>so named from</em> Americus
Vespucius <em>the</em> Florentine, <em>Seven years after</em> Columbus;
<em>although</em> Columbus <em>and</em> Cabota <em>deserved rather the honour
of being Godfathers to it: notwithstanding by this name it
is now known to us, but was utterly unknown to the Ancient</em>
Europeans <em>before their times, I will not say</em> to the
<em>Africans</em> and <em>Asians</em>, for <em>Plato</em> in his <em>Timeus</em> relateth of
a great Island called <em>Atlantis</em>, and <em>Philo</em> the <em>Jew</em> in his
book <cite>De mundo</cite>, that it was over-flowen with water, by
reason of a mighty Earthquake; The like happened to it
600 years before <em>Plato</em>: thus was the <em>Atlantick</em> Ocean,
caused to be a Sea, <em>if you will believe the same Philosopher,
who flourished</em> 366 <em>years before the Birth of our Saviour</em>.</p>

<p>America <em>is bounded on the South with the streight of</em>
Magellan, <em>where there are many Islands distinguished by an
interflowing Bay; the West with the pacifique Sea, or</em> mare-del-zur,
<em>which Sea runs towards the North, separateing it
from the East parts of</em> Asia; <em>on the East with the</em> Atlantick,
<em>or our Western Ocean called</em> mare-del-Nort; <em>and on
the North with the Sea that separateth it from</em> Groveland,
<em>thorow which Seas the supposed passage to</em> China <em>lyeth;
these North parts, as yet are but barely discovered by our
voyagers.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p><em>The length of this new World between the streights of</em>
Anian <em>and</em> Magellan <em>is</em> 2400 German <em>miles, in breadth
between</em> Cabo de fortuna <em>near the</em> Anian <em>streights is</em> 1300
German <em>miles. About</em> 18 <em>leagues from</em> Nombre de dios,
<em>on the South-Sea lyeth</em> Panama (<em>a City having three fair
Monasteries in it</em>) <em>where the narrowest part of the Countrey
is, it is much less than</em> Asia, <em>and far bigger than</em>
Europe, <em>and as the rest of the world divided into Islands
and Continent, the Continent supposed to contain about</em>
1152400000 <em>Acres.</em></p>

<p><em>The Native people I have spoken of already: The discoverers
and Planters of Colonies, especially in the North-east
parts; together with a continuation of the proceedings of
the</em> English <em>in</em> New-England, <em>from the first year of their
settling there to purpose, to this present year of our Lord</em>
1673. <em>with many other things by the way inserted and
worth the observing I present unto your view in this ensuing
Table.</em></p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
